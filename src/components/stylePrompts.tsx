  `Day 0 of 10 hiring a PM to scale Stanley from $600K to $10M ARR.
  Introducing the series 👇
  
  I've spent the last 4 years building Stan - now a $30M ARR business with a team of 50.
  
  Earlier this summer, John and I wanted to experiment with AI.
  
  So we put our business on pause (eh-hem, I mean… left with our team to run 😂) and flew out to London.
  
  (I know you guys are reading!) 
  
  Where we launched Stanley - our LinkedIn AI agent.
  
  That helps Creators make outperforming content in their voice while saving 10 hours/week.
  
  Day 1: Learning AI. No idea what we're doing. 
  Day 15: Public launch → $100K ARR. 
  Day 43: Launched to Beta → $600K ARR.
  
  All by building in public and leveraging our LinkedIn Community.
  
  Our next stop is $10M ARR that we're going to hit in the next 6-12 months.
  
  And to achieve that, I'm looking for a talented PM who will take over the reins on Stanley and take him through the scaling phase.
  
  Over the next 10 days, I'm going to document my journey of finding the right PM for this role.
  
  So if you're a founder hiring, stay tuned with this series so you can copy my playbook (or learn from my mistakes).
  
  I'll see you here tomorrow! 👋🏻
  
  P.S. If you have great PMs in your network interested in scaling an AI project from $600K to 10M ARR, please comment to help them find me 🙏`,
