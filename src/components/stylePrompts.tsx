Even if nobody cares, you learn what people want, what they ignore, what resonates and what falls flat. \n\nThe ideas that flop teach you as much as the ones that take off, maybe more. \n\nThe internet is the ultimate feedback loop, and the only way to lose is to never play.\n\n-- \n\nnote: for validated startup ideas you can take, go to ideabrowser.com (i built this for you!)",

      "Why this is the GREATEST time to be building a software startup\n\n1. Millions of people actually want to try new AI products \n2. Building software is way easier now\n3. Anyone can go viral overnight (it's possible)\n4. APIs turned everything into Lego blocks, you can build on top of Stripe, OpenAI, Twilio without rebuilding infrastructure \n5. Remote work makes it easier to find people to build with you\n6. Agents/automation are making business making more efficient than ever\n7. You don't need VC to get going \n8. The playing field has never been this leveled \n\n\"BuT iT'S mOrE CoMpEtiTive ThAn EveR\"\n\nYeah, more people are building. But most of it is pretty mid. It doesn't really address the pain point or it does it in a way that doesn't really speak to them. \n\nCompetition has always existed. The difference is now you have the same tools as billion-dollar companies. Low barriers to entry cut both ways - yes more competitors can enter, but so can you.\n\n\"YoU mAkE it SoUnD So EaSY\"\n\nBuilding is easier. Building the RIGHT thing is still hard as heck.\n\nMost people give up after month one when they realize coding was the easy part. Distribution, retention, finding product-market fit - that's where 99% fail.\n\nThe tools got better. The game didn't get easier.\n\nBut if you can push through the hard parts that eliminate most people...\n\nYou're competing in a market with infinite demand and the best building tools in history.\n\nfor validated startup ideas worth building, grab one at ideabrowser.com",

      "Jeff Bezos talks about Type 1 vs Type 2 decisions. Type 1 are irreversible (like selling your company). Type 2 are reversible (like launching a product feature). Most decisions are Type 2, but we treat them like Type 1.\n\nSo, I've been trying something new.\n\nJust acting based on how I feel and making decisions quicker. Thinking more about type 1 vs type 2.\n\nIf I feel like I should make the decision, I make the decision. Right then. No sitting on it, no overthinking, no \"let me sleep on it.\"\n\nI don't sit on decisions anymore. That takes up brain space.\n\nTurns out most decisions are reversible anyway. And the mental energy I was spending on \"should I or shouldn't I\" was way more expensive than just making the wrong call occasionally.\n\nI used to think deliberation was wisdom. Now I think it's often just procrastination dressed up as being thoughtful.\n\nThe best decisions I've made in business came from gut instinct made quickly. The worst ones came from overthinking obvious choices until I talked myself out of them.\n\nYour brain is constantly processing information below the conscious level. That \"feeling\" about what to do is usually your subconscious telling you something your rational mind hasn't figured out yet.\n\nMost people ignore their instincts because they think logic is more reliable. But logic without intuition is just slow decision-making.\n\nSpeed compounds. Fast decisions create momentum. Momentum creates more opportunities. More opportunities create better outcomes.\n\nThis might sound obvious, but been helpful to me living a happier and more productive life.\n\nJust sharing in case it sparks something in you",

      "HOW TO BUILD A CHROME EXTENSION BUSINESS WITH AI (my workflow)\n\nGo to any major platform and ask: what's this website missing?\n\nLook for:\n\n– What's annoying users?\n– What's repetitive and manual?\n– What features are hidden?\n– What do power users hack together?\n\nThe biggest websites have millions of users but can't build every feature. LinkedIn can't add every sales tool. YouTube can't add every analytics feature. Amazon can't add every shopping helper.\n\nThat's your opening.\n\nVidIQ built YouTube analytics and has millions of users. Grammarly built writing assistance and sold for $13B. Honey built coupon finding and sold for $4B.\n\nWhy Chrome extensions work:\n\nDistribution is built-in. You're not convincing people to visit a new website or download an app. You're adding features to sites they already use daily.\n\nThe users are already there. The behavior is already established. You're just making their existing workflow better. You piggyback off them (read their terms and services too to make sure it wont bug them)\n\nMost successful extensions follow the freemium model: basic features free, advanced features $5-15/month.\n\nSome go one-time purchase: $20-50 for lifetime access.\n\nOthers do usage-based: $0.10 per action, which scales with value.\n\nHOW TO BUILD MVP\n\nIt's crazy but you can literally ask Claude/ChatGPT/etc to build you a Chrome Extension now\n\n1. Tell Claude: \"Build me a Chrome extension that automatically saves LinkedIn profiles to a Google Sheet when I visit them.\"\n\nIt'll write the entire codebase. Manifest file, content scripts, background scripts everything.\n\n2. Have Bolt/Lovable create a marketing site. Funnels with Perspective or Clickfunnels.\n\n3. Ask ChatGPT to add features: \"Now add a button to categorize contacts as 'hot lead' or 'cold lead.'\"\n\n4. Use Cursor to debug and iterate. The AI handles the technical stuff while you focus on solving the actual problem.\n\n5. You can hire someone to help scale it and with security as revenue comes in. (important step)\n\nFun business to be building If you can get it right. Hope this got your creative juices flowing.\n\nHappy building!\n\n(for startup ideas, check out ideabrowser.com)",

      'How I changed my life\n\n1. I started writing online, even when no one was reading. \n\n2. I started using the internet like a lab testing ideas, aesthetics, and workflows to see what clicked.\n\n3. I began treating every conversation as either energy-giving or energy-draining, then designed my life around the givers. \n\n4. I started screenshotting things that sparked curiosity and treating them like startup seeds.\n\n5. I stopped hanging out with people who rolled their eyes at my ideas and started surrounding myself with builders who said "you should ship that."\n\n6. I realized no one was coming to save my ideas or hand me opportunities. So I picked myself, grabbed my laptop, and kept building until something stuck.\n\n7. I stopped asking “Is this good?” and started asking “Did this create motion?”. \n\n8. I began saying no to everything that felt like should and yes to everything that felt like curiosity.\n\n9. I built things I wanted to exist, then let strangers on the internet shape them. \n\n10. I stopped treating social media like entertainment and started using it like distributionI started naming my projects like brands, even when they were just docs.\n\n11. I began creating systems that worked while I slept. I started valuing quiet ambition over loud mediocrity. \n\n12. I started showing up like it mattered and eventually, it did.\n\n13. I started building things that worked without me, then using that freedom to build bigger things. \n\n14. I started treating my brain like a search engine feeding it better inputs so it could generate better outputs.\n\n15. I realized that building wealth and building happiness use the same playbook: compound what works, eliminate what doesn\'t, and stay in the game long enough for magic to happen.\n\nThe right startup idea can change your life.

      "sam altman just dropped a blog post on why we're entering the era of the \"idea guy\"\n\nso, i wrote down 19 ways to come up with startup ideas in the AI age:\n\n1. ask chatgpt: \"give me 10 tedious workflows a [job title] does that ai could automate.\" rinse and niche down.\n\n2. scroll your own chatgpt history. if you're repeating the same prompt weekly, that's a product hiding in plain sight.\n\n3. search: site:reddit. com \"is there a tool that\" + your niche. you'll find users begging for tools that don't exist. \n\n4. audit where you copy/paste between tools. that friction is a startup idea. \n\n5. read ai tool youtube comments. people write what they wish the tool did, that's your roadmap.\n\n6. join industry discords/slack groups. look for \"does anyone have a tool for...\" complaints. (can set up an automation for that on n8n)\n\n7. use ideabrowser.com to find validated startup ideas from fb groups, subreddits, and google trends. use the ai agents to validate your own ideas (launch pricing ends soon fyi ideabrowser.com) \n\n8. study your calendar for recurring meetings with repetitive prep work. if you're copying templates each time, that's software.\n\n9. browse fiverr for \"i'll use chatgpt to...\" services. those manual workflows are apps waiting to be built.\n\n10. talk to local business owners about their daily excel updates. that's an ai agent waiting to be built.\n\n11. browse g2 for top-rated legacy tools without ai. build the ai layer.\n\n12. ask agency owners what clients beg for repeatedly. if it's annoying and repetitive, it's worth turning into software.\n\n13. read comments on popular (70k+ views) youtube tutorial videos. look for friction points and niche applications for software ideas.\n\n14. find multi-step tutorials using 8+ tools. build the one-click version.\n\n15. scan linkedin job titles in growing industries. ask: \"what would make this person 10x faster with ai?\"\n\n17. look for exploding job titles on linkedin. ask what workflows they're stuck doing manually.\n\n17. find 2-star shopify/wordpress plugins with high usage. low stars + high usage = people care but experience sucks. or clone them with AI, focus on diff geographies and undercut on pricing.\n\n18. join niche facebook groups and look for workflow hacking in comments. build the tool they're manually creating.\n\n19. browse upwork for repeated ai + grunt work gigs. if multiple clients want it manual, it's ripe for productization.\n\nsam altman gets it. your biggest bottle neck is the right ideas (startup ideas/growth ideas).\n\nhappy building. im rooting for you.\n\nwe're all idea guys/gals now.",

      "For the longest time, my podcast was a mega failure. \n\n3 years. 200+ episodes. Embarrassing download numbers. I kept telling myself \"just one more episode\" because I had nothing to lose.\n\nSomewhere around episode 150, recording in my closet, I had this moment: I'm never gonna be the next Tim Ferriss. I can't interview like him. I'm not that smooth.\n\nSo I figured out I'd just focus on giving out 100% sauce. Tactics that actually work. Ideas that fire up founders. Zero fluff.\n\nIt worked.\n\nI went from 10k subs to 300k subs in 18 months. Today \"The Startup Ideas Podcast\" gets millions of listens a month.\n\nAnd most importantly, I'm always getting DMs from founders where they \"stole\" and idea from the show, or learned something that put them on a completely new life trajectory. How cool is that?!\n\nThe closet forced me to focus on the only thing that mattered: whether I was saying something worth hearing.\n\nAnd because I'm not a content creator (ive got businesses to run!), i didnt prepare much. Just shared what I was learning in real-time.\n\nThe constraints made the content better.\n\nI told myself I'll only be able to get out of the closet when I deserve it. When I see comments on yt flowing in. Not just high school friends or fam members.\n\nI eventually upgraded to a home office, but those 200+ episodes in the closet taught me everything. You don't need perfect conditions. \n\nI just wanted to take a minute to thank you for sticking with me.\n\nYou could have spent your time elsewhere.\n\nBut you spent it with me.\n\nI'll give you more sauce than you know what to do with.\n\nTeach you everything I'm learning in real-time.\n\nFree.\n\nThank you.",

      "The most dangerous skillset combo right now: builder (designer or engineer) + filmmaker.\n\nYou're a 1 person factory from creation to distribution.\n\nThink about it. Most companies have two massive cost centers: building the product and marketing it. They hire engineers, designers, then pay agencies or marketing teams to create content that sells what they built.\n\nYou skip all of that.\n\nYou design the app, code it, then film the demo videos that make it go viral. No middlemen. No agency markups. No explaining your vision to someone else who has to translate it.\n\nThe speed advantage is insane. While competitors are coordinating between teams, you're shipping.\n\nThe cost advantage is obvious. You're not paying $50k/month to agencies.\n\nBut the real edge to be honest is the dividends you get from authenticity. When the person who built the product is also telling its story, the message hits different. You understand every detail because you created every detail.\n\nMost founders either build well or market well. The ones who do both become impossible to compete with.\n\nThey're vertically integrated humans in a world of fragmented teams.\n\nAnd when people talk about the $1B solo founder, this is the skillset they'll have.\n\nThey won't just code. They won't just create content.\n\nThey'll be the person who builds the future and films it happening.\n\nAnd for startup ideas you can steal, steal them at ideabrowser.com",

      "Last week Unify's sales team had an offsite in Nashville, and the energy was incredible. The team ended June at 140% to goal, capping off our best month on record.\n \nOur revenue team is split between SF and NYC and the offsite was a great bonding experience for everyone. Being in person together matters.\n \nThe last few months haven't been easy on our sales team. We made a ton of changes after a strong December/January run, and selling Unify got harder starting in February.\n \nBut now we're hitting our stride again, and Nashville felt like a crescendo of that momentum. We rolled out a new pitch deck, two new sales methodologies, and everyone showed up focused on one question: \"how can I be better?\"\n \n--\n2 key points stuck with me when I was reflecting on the trip:\n \n(1) Change is constant\n \nIf you're working at a startup expecting consistency, you're in the wrong place. Our go-to-market motion has evolved so much over the past 12 months. A year ago, our revenue team was myself, Skyler and Tameem. We had 20 people at this offsite, it was a completely different world.\n \nOur go-to-market motion requires us to keep evolving and leveling up as our product does. Our team embraces this.\n \n(2) Inputs \u003E outputs\n \nWhen your team focuses on inputs, the outputs take care of themselves. Yes, quota and revenue closed matter. But focusing on what you can control (the inputs) is what's necessary to find step-function changes.\n \nRight now our team is laser focused on improving our win rate via enablement, training and better osmosis of what tactics are working. We believe that we can 2x+ our win rates, June was a great early indicator of that.\n \nNashville was awesome. We ate too much brisket. Anthony won at go-karting. Skyler wore sunglasses at night.\n \nUnified team unified dream. Excited for this next chapter for our revenue team 🚀",

We also:\n \n(1) Accelerated ARR growth to 17% m/m\n(2) Announced Unify for Sales Reps\n(3) Moved out of both our NYC and SF offices\n \n--\nDouble clicking into each of these:\n \n(1) Accelerated ARR growth to 17% m/m\n \nWe've been investing a ton of energy to revamp and level up how we sell. We tightened our ICP and re-focused around closing great fit customers. We onboarded Hassan to lead RevOps and Gregg as a sales advisor. We've leveled up our enablement, coaching and training. All of these are the inputs to revenue growth.\n \nI'm insanely proud of our whole go-to-market team for a record month.\n \n(2) Unify for Sales Reps\n \nYesterday we put out the biggest product release in Unify's history. We're doubling down on what makes Unify unique - data and workflow in a single platform, and one that's as easy for reps to use as it is for growth teams. With this release, we're re-inventing the sales engagement category.\n \n(3) Moved out of NYC and SF offices\n \nWe've scaled to 47 team members across SF and NYC and with it we're moving into new offices. 353 Sacramento in SF and 665 Broadway in NYC. More to share on these new spaces soon.\n \nAt this scale, I'm fully in editor mode now. My job has evolved from doing the work myself to holding the quality bar and connecting the dots between the right people.\n \nSometimes you need to take one step back to take two steps forward. June was a two steps forward month 📈",

      "Today I’m excited to announce Unify for Sales Reps, the biggest product launch in Unify’s 897 day history 🚀\n\nUnify already helps Growth teams at companies like Perplexity, Cursor, and Airwallex generate hundreds of millions in pipeline. But we kept hearing from customers that the handoff from Growth to Sales was important, but wildly painful.\n\nWe believe that Growth teams and sellers should work together, augmented by AI, to outperform teams 10x their size.\n\n--\nEnter Unify for Sales Reps: a new AI-powered system-of-action, specifically designed to amplify human sellers by automating busywork and surfacing high-intent, actionable leads. \n\nHere are the products that we’re launching:\n\n(1) AI Research Assistant: Instantly synthesizes prospect news, CRM history, and web data into concise, actionable reports, powered by our Observation Model built on OpenAI’s o3. No more context-switching, ever.\n\n(2) Unify Browser Extension: Turn any LinkedIn profile into a fully enriched email or phone number with one click, powered by our market-leading contact data waterfall.\n\n(3) Manual Email, LinkedIn, and Call steps - Layer human-triggered emails, LinkedIn touches, action items, phone calls reminders, and more in multi-step sequences. All this, alongside the automations and managed deliverability Unify is known for.\n\n(4) Tasks Dashboard: A centralized command center for reps to prioritize and execute tasks, and for managers to effortlessly track progress.\n\n--\nUnify is the only platform built to seamlessly serve growth teams and sales reps.\n\nAnd we eat our own dogfood. For our outbound team (Charlie Harry Tarun) 30% of sourced pipeline originates from Unify-powered signals. \n\nA huge shoutout to the team behind this launch: Sam Solomon Noah Young Kunal Ross Aidan Fabian Hyewon Tim Mike\n\nLink to the full launch announcement and demo booking link in comments 👇",

      "This week the Unify NYC team is moving into to our 1st dedicated NYC office at 665 Broadway. I get asked often if being bicoastal between SF and NYC is worth it.\n \nHonest answer: It's complicated, but the benefits have outweigh the challenges. Here's why we decided to do it and what it's meant for Unify.\n\nStartups are all about talent, and we intentionally decided to bet on being bi-costal because we believed it would allow us to recruit the best talent.\n \nIn 2023 as a seed stage company, we did everything we could to get the best talent to join the team. Hyewon, our Design Lead, and Fabian, our Eng Lead, were in NYC and couldn't move. If we wanted our team to be SF only, we never could have hired them.\n \nSo we set up a shared office space that we've been consistently expanding as our team has grown in 2024 and 2025.\n \nHaving a New York presence has absolutely helped us to land talent across product and go-to-market. Today our NYC team is the same size as our SF one.\n \nHaving a sales presence on the east coast also matters, nothing beats selling in person.\n \nBut there's absolutely friction that comes from having 2 offices:\n(1) Costs: 2 offices, travel back and forth, it all adds up. It's cheaper to have one HQ\n(2) Culture: we've tried to be maniacal about trying to maintain our culture, and keeping the core values consistent across both offices. But doing so takes serious effort from the founders. This means that Connor and I are traveling often and spend a lot of time in our NYC office\n \nIf I could migrate everyone to a single office, I 100% would, but that's not realistic, and not the best thing for Unify.\n \nWe're stoked to be moving into 665 Broadway, with it we're entering a new chapter of the Unify story.",

      "Today, I'm thrilled to share an article by OpenAI on our collaboration to engineer growth. And we've got a massive product launch to go alongside it: the Unify Observation Model powered by OpenAI's o3.\n \nIt's been 2 years since OpenAI Startup Fund first invested in Unify. From Day 1 of our journey, Connor and I were drawn to work with OpenAI because it felt clear to us that AI would be the biggest technology shift of our lifetimes.\n \nDespite the release of many amazing products in 2023 and 2024, it's felt like we’ve been living in a world of AI 1.0. A world where AI is helpful, but still isn’t deeply intelligent in the way a human is. This is especially true in GTM tech.\n\nWe can all feel that AI 2.0 is coming, and we’re excited to usher in this new agentic era at Unify. Today, we're taking another step in that direction, with the launch of Unify's Observation Model, powered by OpenAI's o3 model.\n \nAs of today, Unify can now learn, research, and remember like a human seller does.\n \nOur Observation Model runs 24/7, monitoring companies in your TAM to identify high-signal events (new hires, funding rounds, stack changes) through multi-agent workflows that understand context, rather than keywords.\n \nIt understands your relationships with your prospects and customers like a human seller does. It has a flexible memory that regularly updates as new insights are gathered or interactions happen. \n \nTLDR: The Observation Model feels more like a human brain than anything we’ve shipped before.\n \nIf you're curious about the details, I'll leave the link to the full story in the comments 👇 Also, drop me a note if you want a demo.",

      "Jaden Rosenthal on our Account Executive team is at 219% to goal in his first month of full quota with 9 closed deals. I promised that I'd personally buy him a new surfboard if he breaks 300% this month. \n \nOver the last 2 weeks, I’ve listened to 40 sales calls across our team. Jaden does a lot of things right, but something that’s stood out about Jaden is his ability to weave his own personal story about “why Unify” into his pitch. \n \nBefore Unify, he was the #1 SDR of 100 at Placer, having personally sourced $1.6M of closed won revenue. His secret was using intent signals that the rest of the team wasn’t acting on. This deeply resonates with our buyers.\n \nThe Unify sales team is in Nashville this week for an offsite - we’re using the next couple days as an opportunity to reflect on how we can deliver the best possible customer experience with our sales process. We'll have more to share soon.\n \nWe’re hiring for multiple Account Executives. I’ll drop a link to the job description if interested. We'd love to hear from you 👇",

      "This might get me into some fights with AI SDR companies, but I don't care. Billboards across SF are filled with AI SDR companies saying \"Stop hiring humans\" or \"The era of AI SDR is here.\" I couldn't disagree with this take more.\n\nThe constant debate about AI is whether it's replacing humans or augmenting labor. But both of these schools of thought miss the point: you're selling to a human on the other side of the table.\n\nThat human will buy your product, and then another human at their company will have to deploy it and use it on a regular cadence. So even if AI takes away work that humans used to do, someone still needs to manage it, optimize it, and make decisions about it.\n\nPeople are so stuck on the AI debate that they forget that all software replaces work that humans historically did. Humans just evolved the work that they did. And found better things to spend their time on.\n\nThis is why we're still hiring humans at Unify instead of replacing team members with AI. Because there will always be things AI can't replace, like:\n\n(1) Cold calls: Using AI for this is illegal. Plus the best cold callers are 100x better than AI.\n(2) Relationship building: AI can't read between the lines, build genuine rapport, or pick up on the subtle buying signals that humans naturally catch in conversations.\n(3) Meet people in person: if I could replace all my zoom meetings with coffee chats I'd do it in a heart beat. People naturally agree more in person.\n\nYes, AI helps us scale outbound, but humans are what make the entire go-to-market engine actually work.\n\nI don't care if this burns any bridges with AI SDR companies. Those billboards are selling a fantasy.",

We were originally connected through David Ongchoco and have since become friends hanging out in San Francisco.\n \nUnify and Pylon are in similar places and so we get to trade notes often on what's working and what isn't. Marty has become a frequent source of inspiration on everything marketing, social and building great products. I'm consistently blown away by his work ethic and endless creativity / energy.\n \nI learn best through osmosis. Being able to watch how Marty solves problems, tests big ideas, and reflects on his own experiences help me to learn ﻿﻿🙌",

And that's exactly why they've been such a huge driving force behind the company's momentum:\n\n• Adara, who runs our creative content, was the first marketer at Retool and spent time as a seller, where she built her own outbound automation tool. In March, she joined Unify to take a bet on building a new channel: video content. She shipped her first video within days of joining, and within 3 months, she had ideated, filmed, and launched our new series - Unify University.\n\n• Peter was an expert growth marketer and Unify’s power user at Justworks. Now he took on a new motion: partnerships. He has scaled the motion to dozens of partners since he started just a couple months ago.\n\n• Rhea came from a technical background and previously was an Investment Engineer at Bridgewater Associates. She had zero growth experience prior to joining Unify, but built our growth engine from the ground up.\n \nIf this sounds like the kind of team you want to be part of, apply with the link in the comments (or DM me or Rhea)!",

      "Today is day 878 of Unify. If I could give myself one piece of advice on day 1, it'd be to invest in top-of-funnel (automated outbound, social) 6 months earlier than we did.\n \nComing out of 2023, the fundraising environment was rough. The fundraising market was in a hangover coming out of 2021 and 2022.\n \nSo we tried to be extremely efficient and lean as a company. We were conservative about every hire and every dollar we spent – which was fantastic for keeping burn low. But as a result, we underinvested in top-of-funnel ideas early on.\n \nIn retrospect I think this was a missed opportunity. Here's what I would have done differently:\n(1) Start posting 5 days per week on Linkedin a year earlier than I did\n(2) Hire 2 BDRs immediately after finishing our design partner program\n(3) Start our automated outbound program with Unify at the same time\n \nAutomated outbound generated $7M in pipeline for us in 2024. And social content drove 19% of our inbound pipeline. This could be even higher had we started earlier.\n \nIn the early days, over-invest in top-of-funnel to maximize learnings.\n \nP.S. thanks to Pascal for having me on the focal podcast to talk about our founding journey 🙌 I'll leave a link in the comments for the full episode.",

Growth was great, pipeline was strong.\n \nBut then churn started to pick up. \n \nWe realized that for companies who don't have product-market-fit, we were struggling to get them to consistent meetings booked.\n \nIn Q1 of this year we had to take our medicine and tighten up our ICP. As a founder, that trade-off can be tough - it hurt to watch fewer deals come in. But it ultimately paid off:\n \n(1) Our new customer ACV is up +101% since December\n(2) Monthly gross retention has improved by 5% since February\n(3) We've 4x'ed the number of $100k+ ARR customers we have\n \nWhat I've learned is that investing behind ICP is something we need to be continuously doing. Even when we take a bet to go broader, be intentional about what this will do to your ICP and be aware of the risks.\n \nBy narrowing focus on ICP, we were able to dramatically improve customer health in just 3-6 months.",

      "Last Wednesday, we held Unify’s Q1 board meeting at the Emergence Capital offices in San Francisco. I kick off every board meeting with highlights. So, here's what I shared this quarter:\n \n(1) 5 notable logo wins.\n \n(2) AI product: agents are used by 32% of customers (up 2X Q/Q). We announced Operator as a tool.\n \n(3) Redacted product announcement: 12 customers are in beta, and early feedback has been very positive. Announcement coming soon.\n \n(4) Meaningful gross retention improvement: through a combination of efforts on pre-sales, post-sales and product, we’ve improved monthly GRR by 5% from February to May.\n \n(5) We clarified and refined our ICP (more to share here in a separate post).\n \n(6) We’ve 4X’ed the number of 6-figure ARR customers we have.\n \n(7) Outbound is producing our highest quality pipeline, closing at 1.7X the rate of other channels.\n \nI’ll be going deeper on several of these over the coming weeks, follow along to learn more 🙌",

He set an insanely high bar.\n \nIn the fall of last year, we brought on both Nikko and Sam as our next pair of NBRs to do outbound. Both moved into closing roles within 6 months.\n \nAnd our current NBR squad has shown no signs of slowing down. Charlie, Harry, and Tarun hit 130% to goal in April 🤯\n \nConventional wisdom says SDRs/BDRs are entry-level positions for college grads, but at Unify, our NBRs prove the complete opposite is true. We look for strategic sellers who are eager to cut their teeth at outbound. NBRs will be some of the best sellers that we hire.",

      "If you're a Series B-D founder in 2025, the right growth leader will inflect your business. Here are the 4 things you should look for in a potential hire:\n\n(1) Unorthodox backgrounds\n\nYou're not looking for traditional marketers. You want analytical problem-solvers who are first principles thinkers. You want someone who sees growth as a science to be tested and iterated on. You want to hire future founders.\n\nOur Growth Lead Rhea had zero marketing background. Her background (Bridgewater Associates + Kalshi) was unorthodox. \n\n(2) Deep understanding of unit economics\n \nGrowth leaders are constantly making go/no-go decisions based on unit economics. Unit economics are a guiding force in startups. Great growth operators have strong business intuition for if a bet is worth taking based on the economics.\n\nI prefer CAC payback period as my north star for unit economics. As a rule of thumb, \u003C12 months is great, 12-24 months is okay, 24+ months and you need to improve.\n\nSome operators I've seen who've mastered this:\nDennis Sevilla - COO & CFO at Guru\nMax Beauroyre - Head of Growth at Abacum\nEdouard U. - Growth Lead at Pigment\n\n(3) Xfn skills\n \nGrowth sits at the intersection of sales, product, and engineering – teams with very different priorities. Great growth operators can work across these functions seamlessly to deliver impact. It's simple, but not easy to find in practice.\n\n(4) Experimentation and data driven\n \nDiving into pivot tables, SQL queries and dashboards should be second nature. The right candidates will want to validate every decision with data.\n\nIn my experience growth experiments fail 2 out of 3 times. The best operators double down on the winners to squeeze them for every ounce of output. And they see the shimmers of hope in the experiment that failed for the wrong reason.\n\nA great growth leader is your next 10x hire. Go find them!",

      "My unfiltered predictions on the (not-so-distant) future of martech...\nBased on observations from MKT1's Typeform survey of 200+ marketers.\n\n🧩 Enrichment, workflow builders, and AI layers will be in every tool you use. This is quickly becoming table stakes, not a differentiator.\n\n🫥 Your source-of-truth data won’t live front and center in a CRM—it’ll quietly power everything behind the scenes.\n\n🧃 As channels evolve, so do the tools. We’re seeing consolidation and a changing of the guard across inbound, outbound, lifecycle, events, and ecosystem marketing.\n\n🪚 It’s time to be a builder and a creative. New tools = fewer limitations. Carpe diem, marketers.\n\n🧟‍♂️ Legacy tools are falling behind. What once felt modern now feels clunky, especially in CRMs and website builders.\n\n🧬 Marketing productivity = adaptability. It’s not about the best PM tool. It’s about building the stack that gets you there.\n\n--\n\nAgree, disagree, got any other predictions to add to the list?\n\n⬇️ For a longer list and survey results, today's newsletter has it all. We also launch a new GTM Tool Library. \n\nThanks to Typeform, 42 Agency, and Caspian Studios for partnering with us to make this survey and newsletter happen.",

AI helps)\n• 88% say visuals make their work more credible (Canva makes this easy!)\n\nThe report is worth a read ⬇️\nhttps://lnkd.in/e9JjRZcM\n\n#designedwithcanva #canvapartner",

      "What do you wish you knew as a first-time marketing leader?\nAnd why does managing marketers feel like herding cats in a hurricane?\n(This is my new favorite metaphor btw)\n\nIt’s chaotic out there: Budgets are tight, AI is shifting roles, what works in marketing keeps changing.\n\nIn our latest Dear Marketers Podcast & newsletter, we break down the 4 biggest mistakes first-time (and even seasoned) marketing managers make—and how to avoid them. \n\nHere’s what @Jenny Thai, @grace Erickson, and I wish we knew day 1:\n\n1. Chosing Random Acts of Marketing (RAM 🐏 ) over Impact\nWithout clear priorities, teams default to chasing shiny objects and endless requests. Your job is to create focus. Spend time steering your team in the right direction, meaning towards the high-impact work.\n💡 Fix: If you don’t model good behavior prioritizing the right things as a leader, your team won’t either. Have a system for how you set goals and prioritize, even if you don’t manage the whole time.\n\n2. Not Delegating Enough\nNew managers often hang onto the work they were great at as ICs—but that limits scale and growth. This was personally #1 problem (and still is!)\n💡 Fix: Audit your time. Delegate anything that isn’t core or high-impact, whether to a contractor, direct report, or AI.\n\n3. Under-Investing in Coaching\nManaging isn’t just assigning tasks. It’s mentoring, developing, and supporting your team.\n💡 Fix: You don’t need to be the expert in everything. Coaching isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about asking the right questions, helping your reports build confidence, and supporting their career growth—make sure you have scheduled time for these things!\n\n4. Neglecting Internal Marketing\n(Potentially bad news) Internal marketing becomes a bigger part of your job the more senior you get. If other teams don’t understand what marketing does, they won’t value or protect your team’s time.\n💡 Fix: *Don’t assume people understand what marketing does or why it matters, educate them (repeatedly, clearly, and respectfully). \n\n--\n🎙️ Check out Episode 9 and my newsletter out today for more on marketing management--I think we gave non-generic advice, but you tell me!\n\nAnd thanks to Mark Huber for the great question, and Typeform, Framer, 42 Agency, and Caspian Studios for partnering with us on this one!",

      "Should you publish on Substack instead of your company blog? How do you decide?\n\nWhen thinking about where content goes, ask yourself: Are any potential gains in distribution worth the potential losses in control?\n\n📝 When you publish content on your own site, you get full control: analytics, conversion tracking, audience insights ,etc. Everything’s measurable.\n\n💸 But control comes at a cost. You have to build distribution from scratch, and that’s getting harder. \nSEO isn’t what it used to be, and optimizing for LLMs is still a moving target.\n\n📺 Third-party platforms like Substack, LinkedIn, and YouTube offer built-in discovery and growing audiences. \nBut what you gain in reach you may lose in visibility, signal-data, and ownership. It's harder to connect engagement back to revenue and you don't always know exactly who is visiting your content.\n\nThe key is understanding the trade-offs. \nSometimes, control matters more. Sometimes, reach wins. \n\nHow are you thinking of this tradeoff? Or is it not a trade off at all and you are just doing it all?",

      "How to get your marketing team to adopt AI in one day...Run a Marketing AI Hackathon.\n\nI just wrote a whole newsletter on how to do this, which was inspired by:\n1️⃣  The way Clay runs hackathons with their customers. \n\u003E They get teams to adopt custom signals, workflows, etc and get comfortable in the tool in one day\n\n2️⃣ The internal company-wide hackathons we did quarterly when I was at Asana. \n\u003E Intentional moments of scrappy building made a huge impact on both culture and shipping quick, fun wins (like the Asana Yeti)\n\n3️⃣ By AI adoption teams have faced over the past couple of years.\n\u003E Most marketing teams are just scratching the surface on  how to actually use AI (beyond content generation) consistently.\n--\nSo here’s how to run an internal Marketing AI Hackathon:\n✅ Pick a day and make it mandatory\nPut it on the calendar and treat it like a real team ritual. Mid-quarter is usually a sweet spot, or try it at an offsite. One hackathon is good, a quarterly cadence is better.\n\n✅ Set constraints and pick tools\nAvoid blank-page paralysis by giving the team 1–2 constraints: one tool, one use case, or internal-only projects. Share a short list of approved tools. We like Clay, Lovable, Replit, Retool, Canva, Gamma, Figma Make, and more.\n\n✅ Kick off with a short brainstorm\nStart the day with a quick meeting to review the format, goals, tools, and demo timing. Then give the team 15–30 minutes to jam on ideas and form teams.\n\n✅ Build something real in a day\nKeep the scope small. Encourage scrappy builds over perfection...whether it’s an internal tool, content generator, or signal-based campaigns\n\n✅ Demo, celebrate, and roll it forward\nSchedule demos the next day. Maybe even give out fun awards. Pick 1–3 projects to turn into real workflows or templates. AI adoption starts here and it sticks when you actually use what you build.\n\n---\nMy latest MKT1 newsletter includes:\n➡️ 70+ hackathon ideas and AI prompts\n➡️ Examples from Clay’s customer hackathons\n➡️ Details on what we built during our very own MKT1 Hackathon\n\nHave you tried something like this with your team? Or another method to get everyone adopting AI?\n\nThanks to our sponsors for this newsletter: Sendoso, Sequel.io, and Omni Lab",

      "Teach a course → Build a community → Earn customers\n\nThis is the flywheel GC AI used to get from Seed to Series A super fast.\n\nGC AI provides an AI-powered platform for in-house legal teams, they just raised a Series A and are growing like crazy. (Full disclosure: I'm an investor)\n\nHere’s how their flywheel works:\n🧩 Founder-market-fit: Cofounder is Cecilia Ziniti, is a former GC at companies including Replit, who’s been experimenting with AI long before most legal teams were even thinking about it.\n\n1️⃣ Community and education before product: Before launching the company, Ceclilia started teaching Maven courses to help in-house lawyers learn about AI\n \n📈  Courses as acquisition: After launching the product, she kept teaching. The courses still focus on how legal teams can use AI, now with GC AI naturally introduced as part of the solution.\n \n🆓 Built-in trial: Students get a free trial of GC AI get hands-on experience with the product \n\n👯  Ongoing community: Every course cohort joins a Slack group, helping each other adopt AI (and GC.ai). Many of these community members know each other from being in the same cohort.\n\n🎈 Land & expand: The course taker becomes the internal champion, who already  knows the founder and trusts the product.\n\n🎟️ Referrals: Students recommend the course (and tool) to other GCs. The flywheel...flywheels\n\n--\n\nHere’s why I love this:\n🚀 Leveraging their founder-market fit marketing advantage: Cecilia is the expert and the face of the brand. Teaching scales trust better than 1:1 sales.\n\n🎓 Market education: GC AI has cracked the code on how to educate their audience about the problem and the potential solutions—and actually generating demand\n\n🌕 GC AI has found not only a lever to drive acquisition, but also to drive community.\n\n---\nThis is a great example of ecosystem marketing and community at work. And why I believe ecosystem marketing is the next big growth lever.\n\nDoes your company do anything like this? \n\nIf I can find more examples maybe a course as an acquisition channel newsletter is needed.",

      'Is the company blog dead? Is that even the right question? Are you sick of people declaring marketing things "dead" on LinkedIn?\n\nWe covered all of this in our lightning round on the latest episode of Dear Marketers Podcast and newsletter, here\'s the summary:\n\n❓ Is the company blog dead? \n🎙️ Not completely. But with SEO fading as the primary way to “distribute” blog content and LLMs able to generate basic blog content quickly, it’s definitely not alive and kicking.\n\n❓Should you replace your blog with a resource center? \n🎙️Call this part of your website whatever you want, but either way you should likely be making actual resources not just written content for audience. "Vibe marketing" and "vibe coding" with AI make this easier.\n\n❓Is there still a place for long-form content in this new world? \n🎙️ Absolutely. But it needs to be in the right format, make use of expertise, have a stand-out POV, and proper distribution.\n\n❓Should you host your company blog on Substack? \n🎙️ Maybe for individual experts, but company Substacks usually don’t work. The loss of control doesn’t make up for the distribution gains.\n\n❓Should you build a blog for LLMs, not humans? \n🎙️ Think about the LLMs, but don’t forget the humans. Focus on your long-term strategy: writing with a strong and memorable point of view.',

But I then realized it means when you hire influencers, don’t micromanage them. Let them go, run, fly, do their thing, [insert metaphor of choice].\n\nI write all the copy for my newsletter and LinkedIn posts. It’s in my voice, with my frameworks, for my audience.\n\nWhen a brand sends over rigid phrasing or messaging that clearly doesn’t fit, I pass. Because it won’t work—for either of us.\n\nThe whole point of partnering with creators isn’t to make them sound like your comms team.

But we’re not allowed to do that"\n\nSo I ask: "Why not?"\n\n🥛 If you already have high-quality content that hasn’t been fully distributed or repurposed, why wouldn’t you repurpose and distribute—doubling down on what\'s worked?\n🧗‍♂️  It’s often riskier to chase new ideas than it is to double down on the content that’s already working.\n⏳ New content takes time, budget, and coordination\n\nSo the next time you’re pitching a big new content project, ask:\nIs this truly additive and uniquely valuable?\n\nIf not, your default should probably be “no”\n\n🛑 And should you really make no new content for 6 months? Probably not, but maybe pare back your brand new content calendar considerably. And if nothing else this thought experiment makes you really think hard about what you have made, and what you haven\'t distributed.\n\n⬇️ More suggestions on improving your content process in my latest MKT1 newsletter series: "A behind the scenes look at the MKT1 content strategy"',

      "10 learnings from my first 24h creating a website with Lovable.\n↓↓↓\n\nIn ~3h, I built a fully responsive v0 website for HyperGrowth Partners using Lovable.\n\nIt's not finished. It's far from perfect. But it kinda works.\n\nAnd it was my first vibe coding experience.\n\nYeah, it was a vibe — but here's what I've learned.\n\n↓↓↓\n\n1) Start with a big fat prompt\n- Long, structured prompts are better than one-liners\n- Define role, task sequences, n. of pages, components per pages\n- I'll paste mine below\n\n2) Go from wide to narrow\n- It's tempting to nail the details, but force yourself to go wide first\n- Nail the n. of pages, then site-wide elements (navbar/footer/links)\n- Then components per page, then UI per component\n\n3) Use component libraries\n- I used https://lnkd.in/diiTWunz to get pre-made UI components\n- I love 21st dev because you just copy/paste prompts to make the component in Lovable\n\n4) Use other websites screenshots as visual references\n- A picture says more than 1000 words, even to LLMs\n- Instead of writing/whispering to Lovable, paste a screenshot of a UI you like\n- It's impressive how detailed Lovable is in replicating the screenshot\n\n5) Hover over components to look for UI glitches\n- Sometimes Lovable can't tell what's broken in the UI\n- Hover over each component and use \"Edit\" to edit directly\n\n6) Paste tables from spreadsheets or Notion as CMS\n- Just paste tables into the chat and Lovable creates structured CMSs\n- It even adds filters and metadata\n\n7) Upload logos, avatars, and slide decks\n- Just upload logos and avatars, and it allocates intelligently where needed\n- This really calls for a Brandfetch integration with natural language search\n- Also, upload slide decks to import messaging and copy guidelines\n\n8) Restart \u003E Getting stuck\n- If you get stuck for some reason, just start a new project\n- You could just feed your previous version and Lovable will restart from there\n\n9) 1 credit = 1 message\n- Club together multiple tasks in one message to save credits $$$\n- Their new agent mode should curb this but still worth noting\n- Again, shows how clarity is important when working with machines :)\n\n10) Use \"Chat\" to save credits while still getting stuff done\n- Select \"Chat\" button to chat with Lovable without making edits to your project\n- Ask about SEO, back-end, and more\n\nBONUS: don't forget there's a life out there!\n- It's really lovable to build in Lovable, but also kinda addictive (even the first time)\n- And as much as the founders love to hear this, get a break after few hours\n\n__\n\nThat's a wrap!\n\nOnto more vibe coding now.\n\nWhat's been your biggest learning and challenges vibe coding?",

      "Content refresh is a game changer.\nHere’s how Webflow scales it effortlessly ↓↓↓\n\nWebflow has 44000+ articles on his site. At this scale, keeping content fresh becomes a massive task. The pressure mounts when new AI tools create more content than teams can handle. \n\nSEO teams face a bottleneck. Each refresh takes hours. \n- Keyword research\n- Competitor analysis\n- Writing and reviews\n- Manual interlinking \n- CMS management\n- ...\n\nThe result? About 40 articles a year. \n\nThis limits growth and leaves opportunities on the table. \n\nIntelligent automation is the answer. Webflow achieved this with AirOps. \n\nThey transformed their content refresh process. Now, updates happen in minutes, not months. \n\n- Automatic prioritization\n- Multi-modal refresh and enrichments\n- One-click updates\n- Human-in-the-loop\n- Native CMS publishing\n\nThis new model scales quality updates. It keeps brand voice intact. The result is a significant traffic boost in days.\n\n- 5X times faster refresh\n- Boost traffic by 40%\n\n__\n\nI sat with Josh Grant — Webflow VP Growth — to unpack their workflow and content refresh strategy.\n\nVisit HyperGrowth Partners's Substack to learn more!\n\nOr comment below/DM me and I'll share the link directly with you.",

      "AI hasn’t made content better. It has made it easier to create bad content.\nThink of AI as a photocopier. If the original is blurry, every copy is trash.\n\nAI lowered the barriers to create product AND content.\n- With Lovable, everyone can create products.\n- With Claude, everyone can create content.\n\nSo there's SO much more content and competition.\n\nThis makes up for:\n- Higher potential for sameness\n- More noise and overall scarcer attention across channels\n- Much harder chances to stand out, even with a differentiated messaging\n\nBecause:\n- In a world of lot of lookalikes, it's harder to pinpoint outliers\n- When channels are noisy, it's harder to identify signal\n- When everyone follows the herd, it's harder to read the message behind the channel\n\nBecause of this bandwagon effect, differentiation in marketing is becoming harder and harder. \n\nBut the hard part is not to be just unique.\n\nThe hard part is to strike a balance between being trendy and differentiated.\n\nYou need:\n→ To focus on a relatively narrow audience\n→ Develop a contrarian point of view to go against the grain\n→ And balance trendy formats and story arches to match some of the algo rules\n\nLook at Linear's marketing:\n→ They speak only to engineers and product teams\n→ While others chase scale and volumes, they focus on quality and craft\n→ They still do some \"trendy\" stuff: funding announcements, AI agents products, case studies, office hours, etc.\n\nBut they do these things \"their own way\".\n\nAnd they cared to define their own way very well.\n\nIn a world of mediocrity, your own way of doing the best practices is what stands out. \n- Not just fitting into the trend\n- And neither over-indexing on being an outsider\n\nBalancing differentiation and trendiness is the key.\n\nHow are you doing it?",

      "Can't believe it! Last week we (already) ended cohort 1 of GTM Engineer School.\nIt was only end of January that Jared Waxman approached me with this idea.\n\nAnd in just 6 months, we went from idea into a real program and real community\n\nWith real partners, \nReal expert instructors, \nAnd real students!!\n\nEveryone rolled up their sleeves and got hands-on\nThey grappled with prompting, tooling, workflows, and more\nMade mistakes, asked questions, and shared answers.\n\nSome felt lost, dropped out, then jumped back in\nAnd those who did ended up learning, building, and adding to their skillset.\n\nAre our students already top GTM Engineers?\nMaybe not yet.\n\nBut they put the hours and the reps in\nThey learned how to think through core use cases, tooling, and concepts\nAnd got to learn alongside those who are pioneering the GTM tech space.\n\nThis makes them already different from 99% of LinkedIn lurkers\nAnd one step closer to confidently deploy streamlined GTM workflows.\n\nI genuinely loved seeing our students going through this process\nWatching our partners and instructors teach them\nAnd learning alongside with them\n\nBecause I can tell you both Jared and I learned A TON by running cohort 1.\nAnd we still have a long way to go!\n\nThat's why we want to thank all our partners and instructors that made it possible to turn our little idea into a reality.\n\nZach Vidibor Julian Tempelsman Josh Whitfield Bobby Offterdinger Jason Pulliam Wesley Hoang 🛠️ Yash Tekriwal 🤔 Jorge B.

      "One of the best decisions we made with the GTM Engineer School's go-to-market? \nLean into organic social.\n\nBack in January, there was no course, no students, no sponsors — just our hypothesis:\n\nGTM teams are changing fast, and there's a new kind of operating role emerging\n↳ The GTM Engineer\n\nJared and I knew the core of the movement was developing here on LinkedIn, so we decided to lean heavily into it as a channel to drive word of mouth, awareness, and ticket sales.\n\nHere’s how we approached it:\n\n→ Every partner who committed to sponsor the course, we'd announce it\n\n→ Every time we hit specific waitlist milestones, we'd write about it\n\n→ Every time we secured a set of teaching assistants, we'd spotlight their profiles\n\n→ For every module of the course, we organized sneak peeks as webinars\n\n→ Every project milestone (eg. website, pricing, ticket sales milestones), we'd post about it\n\n\n\nBut also, we organized cross-promos with:\n\n\n→ Our 25+ amazing instructors and TAs\n\n→ 15+ of the top 1% of GTM advisors, consultants, and operators in the space\n\n→ And even some of our most committed and passionate students!!\n\n__\n\n\nThe TLDR?\n\n→→→ Turn every milestone into a story to share\n→→ Ask for help to relevant people in your network\n→ And don't be afraid of pounding the rock and be consistent\n\nThat momentum helped us sell out the first cohort.\n(and even overbook factoring in scholarships for the most committed students).\n\nNo growth hacks (never believed in those).\nJust a simple work back plan and consistency.\n\n\nDisclaimer: we also ran some targeted outbound and thought leadership ads, but they were the seasoning to the organic LinkedIn \"main dish\".\n\n\nPS. Next week we finish cohort 1, and we're regrouping to iterate on our students' feedback and prepare cohort 2. If you want to join us for that, sign up below ;)",

      "Time is money — wasting it is...a waste.\nBut what most people don't understand is that:\n\nFor knowledge workers (like us in tech), giving feedback is one of the biggest levers that make up the *value of your time*.\n\nThink about it:\n\nIn tech, you either:\n↳ Creating (code, words, flows, designs, videos, setting up tools)\n↳ Collaborating (ask, collect, and iterate on feedback)\n\nVirtually 100% of everything that is created is shared for feedback/collaboration\n\nIf you're:\n↳ An IC: you probs spend 60% creating, 40% collaborating\n↳ A manager: you probs spend 80% collaborating, 20% creating\n\nThe value of collaboration translates into real money:\n↳ If your avg IC salary is $80k/yr, the value of collaboration is ~$32k/yr\n↳ If your avg manager salary is $150k/yr, the value of collaboration is ~$120k/yr\n\nScale that to (considering a 1:5 manager-to-IC ratio):\n• A 10 people startup: ~$470k/yr\n• A 100 people lower mid-market: ~4.7M/yr\n• A 500 people upper mid-market: ~23M/yr\n\n___\n\nSo if I create a piece of knowledge, then \"ask for feedback\", AND:\n↳ Comments are too diverging, unclear/vague, or non-constructive\n↳ Too diverging = this might be relevant but it's way out of scope\n↳ Non-constructive = leave me thinking \"what would it be better instead?\"\n↳ Unclear = leave me thinking \"what did they mean?\"\n\nThis translates in LOTS OF WASTED TIME/MONEY:\n\n→ Dollar burned from longer feedback loops\n→ Reworks and decision-making latency\n→ Emotional costs of frustration that lead to churn/turnover\n\nLet's say this amount to ~25% of their week's time chasing feedback and re-syncing (Atlassian 2025 study), that's about:\n\n• A 10 people startup: ~$160k/yr\n• A 100 people lower mid-market: ~1.3M/yr\n• A 500 people upper mid-market: ~6.5M/yr\n\n___\n\nInvest in communicating well.\n\nHere's what I try to do every time I give feedback:\n\n1. Be clear/specific: pre-emptively anticipate ancillary/clarification questions\n2. Focus on outcome: give feedback that converge on the team outcome\n3. Use examples: show what good looks like to give directions on your standards \n4. Know when to diverge: keep diverging feedback for upstream brainstorms\n5. Keep tabs on open threads: unblock who rely on your opinions/approval, fast!\n\nGiving proper feedback saves you time and money. \n\nAnd will also make you a more respected, easy-to-work-with IC/manager.\n\nLet's start act like we care, shall we?",

      "Just listened to Karri Saarinen's talk from Figma's Config. \nHe argues that:\n\n↳ \"Technology makes it easier to build, but harder to care (for the craft)\"\n↳ \"We replaced purpose with metrics\"\n↳ And we delegated \"judgment to AB testing\"\n\nAnd he thinks that the reason for that is that:\n↳ \"When you can do more and focus on the process\"\n↳ You can distance yourself from understanding \"what's the right solution\"\n\n___\n\nMy two cents:\n\n1) At its core, technology is a deflationary force:\n\n- It IS about *doing more with less*\n- It's the designer's job to intimately know a process' status quo\n- Abstract it's key components and first principles\n- And design an incrementally or radically better way of conducting such process\n\nSo NO — I don't think it's technology's fault that we lose focus on the craft.\n\n\n2) I think it's about the *market* dynamics\n\n- Tech VCs demand VOLUME, SCALE, and NOW \u003E quality\n- This begets speed to win over competition and maximize returns\n- And AI (extremely deflationary tech) lowers barrier to entry\n- Compounding this frantic competition, and speed to win over others\n\nIt's the capitalistic nature of tech and its hyper-competitive dynamics that I think are at the core of our frantic race towards metrics in spite of craft/quality\n\n(not saying it's a bad thing but this is more like it than tech itself)\n\n\n3) In this market, QUALITY = fx(CRAFT) = DIFFERENTIATION → because it's scarce\n\nBUT it's not abstract, even Karri shows it in his slides: \n\n- Linear has tenets on quality coming from their customers — who qualify it as ↓\n- Intentionality, seamlessness, speed, personal, and scale (all proxies of \"quality\")\n- Seamlessness = knowledge of the customers' process and experience\n- Intentionality = developing opinions that show you've empathized with customers\n- Personal = making the customer feel listened to (back to empathy)\n- Speed = deliver solutions based on intentionality, fast (eg. support)\n- Scale = the whole team delivers with consistent intentionality and speed\n\n↓↓↓\n\n4) From quality = fx(craft) to TASTE\n\n- Quality is not abstract but RELATIVE because it depends on TASTE\n- Which is determined by the tastemakers of a specific sector/industry\n- Tastemakers are those who turn deep understanding of the market into strong POVs\n- That's why Linear has emerged as a mature, hyper-competitive market\n- They deeply understood the proxies of quality *their customers care about*\n- And baked them into their product as \"craft\" and in their marketing as \"taste\"\n\n__\n\nSo in the end, I believe:\n\n1) In tech, you must have speed, do volumes, and deliver numbers to play the game\n2) B/c of market dynamics, while most catch up w/competition, craft and taste get lost\n3) But if you want to play the long game, you must layer craft and taste on top\n4) Craft shows you know how to design a different, better quality product\n5) And taste shows that you know how to brand it and market it differently\n\n\nPS. Thanks Karri for the inspo — big fan of Linear!",

      "This week marked 3 years as a solopreneur at Genesys.\nIt's been a rollercoaster, but I'm loving it  ↓↓↓\n\nTHE BACKSTORY\n\nMay 2022\n- Got fired from OnDeck (ODF) after only 4 months (layoffs season)\n- Lost 80% of my net worth in the crypto bubble burst (lol)\n- Almost break up with my now fiancé\n\nEverything happened in one, intense week BUT:\n- I knew I didn't want to get another FTE\n- Had done 1-2 consulting gigs before\n- Had enough experience to try my luck\n\nSo I refreshed my LinkedIn, and put myself out there.\n(While started doing couple therapy lol)\n\nThings took a rapid twist:\n- Found my first client from the ODF portal (ironic)\n- Then another one came from a uni friend\n- All of a sudden, I was floating\n\nAnd so it began.\n\n__\n\nY1 strategy:\n• Positioning: generalist marketer\n• Target: any tech startup\n• Channels: personal network\n• Model: retainer by hours\n• Goal: keep floating\n\nEOY '22 (7 mos in):\n- Clients: ~3/mo (started writing HyperGrowth Partners NL)\n- Days worked: ~14/mo\n- Revenue: 110% of my prev. job salary\n\nThings to work on:\n→ Get to \"at capacity\"\n→ Get better, more known clients (++ social proof)\n→ Work with clients who value quality work\n\n___\n\nY2 strategy\n• Positioning: generalist, B2B SaaS only\n• Target: seed to Series As\n• Channels: personal network\n• Model: retainer by deliverables\n• Goal: go upmarket (Series A)\n\nEOY '23 (per quarter):\n- Clients: ~5/m (landed first Series A SpotDraft!)\n- Days worked: ~17/mo\n- Revenue: 178% YoY\n\nThings to work on:\n→ Niche down positioning/target\n→ Keep at it with content, start posting on LinkedIn\n→ Let go of non-fit clients\n\n__\n\nY3 strategy\n• Positioning: B2B SaaS product/content marketer\n• Target: Series A-B (some seed)\n• Channels: personal network, LinkedIn\n• Model: retainer by deliverables\n• Goal: go upmarket, grow brand/content\n\nEOY '24 (per quarter):\n- Clients: ~6/mo (Owner.com, Ahrefs, Toast, AirOps, Ethena, Common Room)\n- Days worked: ~18/mo\n- Revenue: 134% YoY\n\nThings to work on:\n→ Automate, streamline, and productize\n→ Consistency with content/social proof\n→ Say 'no' more (hardest part)\n→ More strategic collabs, content, partnerships (eg. GTM Engineer School)\n\n___\n\nWHAT KEEPS ME GOING?\n\nI don't need/want to:\n- \"dominate the market\"\n- get to $$XXM ARR\n- be the best at X\n\nWhat I care about is:\n→ Financial freedom: maintain or improve my lifestyle\n→ Location freedom: work from where I want\n→ Time freedom: retain leverage on my calendar, choose who to work with\n→ Fulfilment: do something I enjoy, keep learning, and feel alive\n→ Optionality: own my choices, and be able to change them\n→ Equity: build my own, not someone else's\n\n__\n\nWithout this set up, it'd have been much harder to:\n- Take ~40 days off p/y\n- Work from Tokyo or Rome 1-2 months p/y \n- Quality time with my 101 yo grandpa\n- Spend her bdays with my Mom\n- Celebrate my old man's retirement in Patagonia\n\nThis post is to say: I'm damn grateful!\n⤷ And if I made it this far, you can do it too!",

      "GTM Engineer School keeps getting better (ok, I might be biased).\nBUT today it felt special (and meta!) to have the *first* GTM Engineer Yash Tekriwal 🤔 run us through some history and princioples (among other things).\n\nSO what is a GTM Engineering and why it's not a fad?\n\nIn Yash's own (paraphrased) words:\n\n⤷ It combines RevOps, BDR/SDR, and Marketing in one role\n⤷ RevOps: knowledge of data, systems and connecting tools\n⤷ BDR/SDRs: knowledge of the business, sales process, and the art of selling\n⤷ Marketing/Demand Gen: knowledge of the ICP, advertising, and being creative\n\nWhy it's so powerful:\n\n1) Role consolidation speed things up:\n\n⤷ Cross-functional collaboration is resource intensive\n⤷ Consolidating multiple roles into one adds substantial speed\n⤷ Now few people can do the job (and have the impact!) of entire teams\n\n2) Consolidation means leaner, most effective teams:\n\n⤷ Leaner teams don't just achieve more, they save time, money, and reduce risk\n⤷ These savings translate into time-to-market advantage\n⤷ Which is critical in our fast-paced, ever-competitive market\n\n3) Automation makes space for more creative freedom:\n\n⤷ With the right (AI) tools, GTMEs streamline/automate part of their workflows\n⤷ BDRs love the sales process, but repetitive tasks drain energy\n⤷ Automation makes headspace for more creative, human work to happen\n\nThe last piece especially stroke a chord:\n\n- What AI/automtion enables is not just productivity\n- But it makes more space for more human, creative work\n\nAnd hearing the killer GTMEs TAs in the breakouts...\n\n🦾Eric Nowoslawski Patrick Spychalski Arpit Singh Jorge B. Macías 🇵🇷 Kellen Casebeer\n\n...their crazy enrichments, Claygent prompts, and creative use cases (🔥🔥🔥) are living proof that GTME is not just possible...\n\n↓↓↓\n\nIt's real, alive, and growing!\n\nAnd w'ere happy that GTM Engineer School is playing a part into growing this community.",

      "\"I know GTM Engineering\".\n\nIt's not that easy.\n\n1) You've seen 100+ posts on LinkedIn on Clay or AirOps workflows?\n↳ You don't know GTM Engineering, but you might understand what it looks like\n\n2) You have 10+ SDRs and you need to 10x their output and don't know which tools you need\n↳ You don't know GTM Engineering, but you now you need to learn more about it\n\n3) You've built a few workflows and are ready to expand from outbound to content (or viceversa)\n↳ You're on the way to know GTM Engineering, but you're ready to invest more into it\n\n__\n\nIf you're in any of these situation, then GTM Engineer School is for you.\n\n__\n\nPS. Going through the program won't guarantee you'll know GTME.\n(not like Neo knows Kung Fu in the Matrix)\n\nWe're laying out the building blocks, but you'll need to:\n\n→ Show up to class with pre-class homework done\n→ Bring in your data/context (or use our examples)\n→ Put in the work and build yourself in class\n→ Get lost, make mistakes, and ask questions\n→ To then get back on track\n→ Keep iterating on the work after class\n\nThat's the only way you learn.\n\nThat's when you'll know GTM Engineering.\n\nSpoiler alert: this applies not just to GTME, but anything.\n\nWe have less than 5 tickets available — snag yours here: \nhttps://lnkd.in/dEctSm5T\n\nSee you in 10 days :)",

      "Ever have that moment when your job and secret passion collide? 👀\nThat's basically my origin story. And why I’m so excited to announce my next venture. But first, the story that changed it all:\n\nIn my first AE role, we sold so much of the product that we had to FREEZE sales. It was during that time that the company asked me to put my engineering skills to the mix.\n\n“Hey Jorge, while we can’t sell the product, maybe you can look for ways to improve our operations?”\n\nI had to start with a list of things that I knew were taking too much time:\n- Manual prospecting\n- Finding the right contacts + email addresses\n- How to best present the tool in a way that made sense to our potential clients\n\nMy industrial engineering background taught me one critical thing: I was drowning in the WRONG work. So much time spent on repetitive prospecting tasks when I should've been focusing on actual conversations and getting in front of people that could buy.\n\nThe engineer in me couldn’t take it. So I started to work on these systems:\n- Pre-built and customized demos that WOWed our customers\n- Initial “reasearch” cold call strategy to get information on possible tools to integrate with and pain points\n- Scraping public business websites and databases and tying that data back to our CRM\n\nI was doing GTM Engineering before it was a thing.\n\nAfter the 3 month sales freeze, we were closing deals in half the time and our close rates increased 2.4x.\n\nFast forward to my next 3 sales roles, and all were having similar problems. Most didn’t have systems in place that allowed sales to do what they do best: talk to customers.\n\nThe lightbulb moment? Starting to play with Clay (not the stuff that makes your hands dirty).\n\nI got a freelance opportunity. Then got referred to others. Pretty soon I was making as much as my FT role. And with my wife being pregnant, I realized I could:\n- Do what I genuinely loved\n- Work remotely to be present for my new baby\n- Make more money serving sales teams the best way I know how\n\nThe best business ideas aren't fancy innovations, they're solutions to the problems you personally lived through.\n\nAnd that’s why today I’m so excited to announce The GTM Engineering Company. To help sales teams create scalable outbound engines that break through the noise and drive revenue.\n\nI’ve got 2 spots opening up in July, DM me if you want to learn more. Check out my new website: https://lnkd.in/eqwez-ra",

      "Steal this decision matrix (vibe coded by yours truly) that determines the level of automation to use in your outreach. Here's the 7-step plan to operationalize it: \n\n1. Figure out your ICP (what makes a great company). Enrich data and 'tier' your accounts (eg: High-Fit, Medium-Fit, Low-Fit). AI is great at this research. \n\n2. Bucket titles into two categories: Decision Maker (aka \"above-the-line\") or Individual Contributor (aka \"below-the-line\"). AI is very good at doing this at scale. \n\n3. Come up with a list of the top signals for your business. Use AI to brainstorm the top 20 signals for *your* business (the more specific/niche, the better). \n\n4. Capture these signals across data sources and customized AI agents/workflows. \n\n5. Operationalize these 'decision frameworks' in something like Clay or n8n, to push automated outreach or put in front of reps in Slack, CRM, or SEP.  This image is basically a Clay table. \n\n6. Have AI generate copy and scripts based on the company, person and signal. \n\n7. Keep iterating over time. As your market (inevitably) evolves, your GTM motion should evolve. \n\nPS - For step # 3, drop your website below and I'll share some ideas on signals you should use, based on a prompt/output I've been working on.",

      "AI is incredibly good at building custom, foundational datasets in your CRM. The stuff your best reps are doing manually, can now be done at-scale (with AI agents/workflows). It's something that I didn't realize was possible until I started doing it for customers this year. \n\nNow, when people come to me to get help with modern Pipe Gen (plays, signal-based selling/automated outbound, Clay and AI workflows), I almost always suggest that we build the foundational dataset first - in their CRM.\n\nSo, I'm testing out a new service:\n\nFoundational Data, enabled by AI.\n\nI'm still working out the details so,\nI want feedback. \n\nSignals, automation and AI are great (really great).\nThey're the obvious future GTM playbook.\nBut, they don't work nearly as well if your foundational data is not dialed first. \n\nThis foundational data layer (in your CRM) also helps with other GTM workflows downstream, like: \n\n- Territory planning (cutting books of business)\n- Lead routing \n- Account scoring \n- Persona reporting \n- Data rooms for investor/board decks \n- (Deep) account research for AEs/AMs\n- NRR cohorting \n- Setting up manual vs. semi-automated vs fully-automated workflows \n- Churn prevention \n- Automated signal scanning \n- Clay workflows \n- Competitor analysis \n- Coaching around consistency \n- And so much more\n\nAI and automation are magic. \nBut they're only as good as the foundational data layer they're built on. \n\nThe good news is: AI can be used to build a great foundational data layer (meta, I know). \n\nComment below (or DM me) if you're interested in learning more about this service.",

      "I started working with a new client this month. We're modernizing their GTM engine from the ground up. That includes cutting old tools, built for the old playbook. \n\nWe have cut two tools ($80K and $45K annual contracts) and are purchasing two new tools ($9K and ~$15K). \n\nThat's a net savings of $101,000 a year.\n\nAnd with this $ savings, we'll get much *better* results than before, after these new tools are implemented thoughtfully (+ architected and operationalized). \n\nSaaS is at an inflection point.\n\nThe old vendors that support the old playbook, are going to die a slow and painful death unless they re-invent themselves. \nMany companies—even big ones, like HubSpot, Zoominfo, and Intercom—are doing so. If you're a startup, there's no excuse. Adapt or die. Vendors who don't will get chopped without knowing what happened. \n\nThis goes for teams too. You have to adopt in this moment in time. \nWhich requires completely re-learning a completely new playbook. \nIt's not about adding a single new tool and calling it a day. \nIn fact, it's not just about the tools either. \nIt's the design of your GTM system (people, process, tooling). \n\nIt's an exciting, but also scary, time right now. \n\nYou're either paddling into the new (AI) wave. \nOr you're stuck boogie boarding the beach break. \n\nDon't be a kook. \nPaddle in. \nThe water is warm. \n😂",

      "You’ve got leverage you’re not using. And your pipeline is suffering.\n\n\nThat was the message from Brendan Short (The Signal), founder of The Signal and author of one of my favorite GTM newsletters.\n\nWe talked about a role that didn’t really exist 18 months ago, yet may be the most impactful hire you can make right now: the GTM Engineer.\n\nWhy? Leverage.\n\nLeverage is usually just a word people say now instead of “use” so they sound smart. But that’s not what Brendan means. He means *actual* leverage: something that takes a small input of work and turns it into a big output of force.\n\nAnd that’s how he sees GTM Engineering—using systems and AI to create leverage for your sales teams where human inputs create outsized GTM outputs\n\nOur teams are suffering through manual workflows and missing unstructured data that could generate real pipeline. Unfortunately reps don’t have the time, and RevOps doesn’t have the bandwidth to fix it. GTM Engineers sit at the intersection of ops, growth and sales to change that.\n\nIn this week’s Uncharted Territory, I talked with Brendan about:\n\n1. Why GTM Engineering emerged now and what it’s really for\n2. Where the role fits in your org and how to comp it\n3. How to know if you’re ready to hire a GTM Engineer\n4. Whether to outsource, hire or upskill internally\n\nIf you want to impact your pipeline in H2 and—in the process—nudge your org closer to 10x sales reps, give it a read:\nhttps://lnkd.in/g3w8b8qS",

      "I got lots of asks for an example of a 'good' resume, so I thought I'd brush mine up and share the format that's worked for me throughout my career. \n\nthere isn't a single format that works for everyone - you might need 2 pages, you might need more bullets, you might need more stats, you might need to include publications, etc. \n\n📌 the most important thing is that the person reading it understands where you spike immediately, and that you're answering the questions they'll have about you as quickly as possible. \n\na few best practices that apply to everyone's resume, in my opinion as someone who's read thousands and thousands of resumes for roles: \n\n〰️ make it easy to read. make it easy to read. make it easy to read. \n\n〰️ lead with what makes you stand out from everyone else applying. why should the person reading it want to have a conversation with you to learn more? \n\n〰️ don't use numbers and stats just to fill space - use them to emphasize your greatest strengths and proven ability to drive impact and results\n\n〰️ you don't have to include everything you've ever done - truly! \n\n〰️ make sure the job title or function you're applying for is included somewhere, either in your summary (looking for a role in X) or in a previous job title or description. hiring managers will often filter for inclusion to filter out spray and pray applications. \n\n〰️ if you have a gap in your career from raising a family, taking a mental health break, caring for a loved one, etc., include one line about it. no need to justify - the hiring manager will either accept your gap or they won't - you won't change their mind. \n\n👋hiring managers - what'd I miss? also - the folks reading this post are likely looking for roles, so if you're hiring, comment your JD ♥",

      "welcome back to another edition of ✨I'm reading hundreds of resumes right now, so I'm going to share some unsolicited resume advice✨\n\nDO: \n- list your most recent 2-3 positions and companies clearly. The hirer needs to know what you've been up to, and where - that's the primary initial signal for whether you might be a good fit.\n\n- add 1-2 easy-to-skim bullets for each role about your focus and impact. they're looking for whether you've done adjacent work to what they need to do, and whether you've done it successfully. \n\n- include your linkedin url so the hiring manager can do an easy click out\n\n- instead of a summary, include a bullet or two on anything specific to the role if relevant (ex. willing to relocate, highly related side hustle, demonstrated passion for the area of focus, etc)\n\n- if you have the capacity, email or dm the hiring manager with a short, bulleted note about why you're uniquely qualified for the role\n\nDON'T\n- write a long, opinionated summary paragraph that's obviously the same for every role you apply for\n\n- make the reader hunt for your titles and companies\n\n- email or DM the hiring and ask for a 1:1 call to ask me questions about the role, or 'learn more about what the company is up to'\n\n- include those graphics that show how strong you are at different skills - they're distracting and confusing to interpret\n\nplease let me know if any of this is confusing in the comments. it's really frustrating to see so many high quality candidates whose resumes aren't well formatted, making them easy to miss in the process of reviewing hundreds in a queue.",

      "I’m so, so excited to share that I’ve joined Gagan and the team at Maven to lead growth as we reinvent post-grad education for ambitious people. \n\nIt’s rare to get the opportunity to join a team that's solving a problem you care about, in a role that you feel your entire career has prepared you for. I’m grateful and couldn’t be more excited. \n\nI never pursued an MBA or a Masters, despite frequently feeling like I ‘should’ from my colleagues, peers, and industry. The format never worked for me - I was already building a great network, and I only really needed a few of the courses to meaningfully level up. Two years in school would be two years lost building and doing. The teachers might be great, but they also might be out of touch, or not have the context I’d need. \n\nMy mission at Maven is to get more smart people teaching more smart people. The opportunity for experts and industry vets to share their learnings, stories and perspectives with the next generation of leaders is massive, and IMO is the path to a much more effective knowledge marketplace for people investing in reaching their potential. \n\nI started teaching on Maven earlier this year, and it’s been nothing but an absolute joy. I connected with incredible fellow instructors, refined my POV on the subject I was teaching, established my credibility in my area of expertise, and met so many interesting, driven, and brilliant learners who were investing, through me, in their future success. \n\nIf you’ve ever thought about teaching in any capacity, I’d love to hear from you. My email is mallory@maven.com. \n\nAnd if you've been meaning to use your L&D budget, or to invest in upskilling, we happen to have a sale going on this week on our top 100 courses. LMK what you choose!!",

      "This was my favorite slide from the presentations at our Spheres conference.\n\nIt’s Charles Eames’ conceptual visualization of their design philosophy, illustrating how successful design emerges at the intersection of three key domains: \n\n- The Design Office: representing the designer’s capabilities, tools, and creative processes\n\n- The Client: encompassing the specific needs, goals, and constraints of those commissioning the work\n\n- Society as a Whole: reflecting broader cultural, ethical, and social considerations\n\nEames emphasized that the most effective and meaningful design occurs where these three areas overlap, where the designer can work with “conviction and enthusiasm”.\n\nThe diagram itself is intentionally abstract and “wiggly,” capturing the non-linear and often messy nature of the design process.\n\nI love a visualization of thought process - have you seen other great ones?",

      "I honestly can’t believe he shared this. But Tyler Calder (PartnerStack CMO) shared their whole GTM strategy with me. And it’s not influencer fluff, it works.\n\nTyler is going deeper on this in a live event for marketing leaders on June 26. \n\n𝗥𝗘𝗚𝗜𝗦𝗧𝗘𝗥 𝗛𝗘𝗥𝗘: https://keyplay.io/event/\n\nHe's talking about how over the last year+ they’ve been able to:\n\n-- Increase pipeline value by 58%+\n-- While DECREASING cost per dollar of pipe by 35%.\n-- And improving NRR, & ACV\n\nSo… getting MORE efficient as they scaled, not less.\n\nAs a marketer I’m always looking for real playbooks that I can actually use, because they come from another practitioner. Proven. No incentives. This is one.\n\nHis playbook is simple but beautiful: (full breakdown here: https://lnkd.in/e6qJcsx7)\n\n1️⃣ 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘀 & 𝗜𝗖𝗣 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝘀 (& 𝗻𝗼 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗜𝗖𝗣 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱)\n\n-- They built an AI-powered ICP Model (with Keyplay) that lets them hyper-focus on accounts that are showing fit signals. Built on real modern fit signals like:\n\n1. Are they using a PartnerStack competitor?\n2. Are they actively hiring for partnerships?\n3. Do they have multiple partner motions live (affiliate, referral, agency)?\n4. Are they growing? Recently funded? Product-led? Employee count?\n5. Are they investing into areas that partnerships could either compliment or displace because it’s more efficient?\netc.\n\n2️⃣ 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: 𝗠𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘄. 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝘀𝗲𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 & 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻\n\n-- Prioritize accounts by fit (Tier A, B, C, D)\n-- Tailor plays to accounts by segment & tier\n-- Use AI signals to segment deeper and hyper-personalize\n\n3️⃣ 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴'𝘀 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗸𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗷𝗼𝗯. \n\nImagine what you could do if you knew every account in your market…\n\nYou’d build a report that shows every account and their engagement. \n\nThen you’d report on how that changes weekly, monthly, quarterly…\n\nThey do exactly that.\n\nThis isn't a shiny tactic. But I guarantee if take this seriously you’ll get something out of it that will work.\n\nIt's fundamentals done right. And a perfect reminder for any marketing leader.\n\nRead the in-depth breakdown here: https://lnkd.in/e6qJcsx7",

      "If I became CMO of a $5M ARR B2B startup, here's what I'd do in my first 30 days to 2x ICP pipeline:\n\n1. Create a list of every target account in my ICP.\n\nI'd ask sales & CS about which factors make a great account. Then I'd bring in real-life data, analyzing all won/lost deals over the past 18 months to see which factors led to the highest expected ARR per 100 opps (equation: win rate x average ACV x NRR x 100).\n\nThese factors would almost certainly include industry, company size, and geo. But I'd look to go a level deeper factoring in tech signals, hiring signals and other indicators of buying intent.\n\n2. Identify all the most relevant contacts at those target accounts.\n\nI'd start with initiator and champion personas. Users, influencers, and exec buyers could come later. This data used to be hard to access, unreliable & expensive -- that has quickly changed.\n\n3. Figure out where those target accounts are in their buying journey.\n\nIf there were 1,000 accounts in my ICP, how many were we able to identify & market to? How many are aware of us (i.e. visiting the website, engaging with ads, opening emails, etc.)? How many are interested (i.e. viewing an interactive demo, visiting high-intent pages, starting a free trial)? And how many are considering a purchase (i.e. they're sales pipeline)?\n\nFrom there, the bottlenecks become obvious to the entire team. It's time to tackle them. \n\n4. Build a pod around the biggest bottleneck.\n\nI'd spin up 10+ tests in the first week. The variables I'd play with: the account signal, the message, the channel, the offer, and the level of 1:1 personalization. (A manual approach would be fine to start with -- I can automate what works later.)\n\nThe lowest hanging fruit is usually to convert aware/interested accounts into pipeline. This might mean warm outbound to convert website visitors, testing personalized video over LinkedIn, offering exec access, etc.\n\n5. Create a 🔥 content asset that I know will resonate with my target accounts.\n\nMy starting hypothesis: a State of X report featuring interviews & quotes from my ICP. I'd start with highly referenceable existing customers for social proof (low-hanging fruit). I'd then use the report as an excuse to message ICP prospects (the side-benefit: account-specific insights to personalize campaigns).\n\nI'd build this report in public -- creating a content \u003C\u003E community flywheel -- to already drum up interest from my ICP well before the report was published. \n\n--\n\nWhy this 30 day plan works: (a) it's focused on the best-fit accounts, (b) it brings tight alignment between marketing \u003C\u003E sales, (c) it creates quick wins -- earning trust to take bigger swings, (d) it's the best possible onboarding, and (e) it's aggressive -- setting the bar high.\n\nAnd, if it doesn't work, perhaps I'd propose another brand refresh 🙃\n\n#marketing #icp #abx",

      'Over the past 6 months, the way I’ve used AI the most… is not for writing code, not for drafting slides,  and definitely not for posting on LinkedIn (otherwise I’d be posting a lot more).\n\n🧠  It’s for self-discovery and self-coaching ❤️ .\n– When I feel overwhelmed, it helps me unpack my emotional responses and thinking patterns \n – When I upload my old writing and life choices, it helps me connect the dots and uncover what truly matters to me\n – In tough parenting moments, it educates me to be a better mom\n (you’ll get this once your kids hit their teenage years)\n\nI used to think this was an odd use case for AI. After all, most people on LinkedIn seem to be optimizing prompts, automating workflows, or building agents.\n\nAnd here I am—using it to reflect on myself, parenting, relationships, life, and meaning.\n\nThen I came across this chart from Harvard Business Review.\n\nThe top 3 GenAI use cases in 2025?\n1. Therapy and emotional support\n2. Organizing your life\n3. Finding purpose\n\nMaybe I’m not an outlier after all.\nMaybe the real power of AI isn’t just helping us do more—\nbut helping us become more "human".',

      "Chief Marketing Officers usually get $250k+ salaries. \n\nThey come in and look at how to spend a bunch more money. \n\nIf I was a CMO, I'd instead look at implementing a ton of no cost or low cost options to drive leads and grow.\n\nHere's what I'd do:\n\n1. Founder content- we'd make the founders mini influencers\n2. Niche podcast- we'd create a podcast for whatever niche we are in\n3. Reviews sites: Clutch, G2, etc, we'd create campaigns to push reviews in a big way\n4. Website redo- it blows my mind how bad 90 percent of y'all's websites are\n5. Influencer partnerships- we would find influencers, newsletters, conferences, podcasts in our niche and sponsor them. Many can be very low cost or affiliate models\n6. Community- we'd build community within our customer base and show proof of it any way we can across socials\n7. Social: we would show off our team, our momentum constantly \n8. Newsletter: we'd create our own weekly newsletter that would feel like a secret club membership\n\nWhat other low or no cost ideas would you add?",

It’s based on millions of anonymous Claude.ai conversations.\n\nChart Legend:\n▪️ Black: % of US workers\n🔺 Red: % of Claude conversations\n\nTop 3 AI Adoption Categories:\n1️⃣ Computer & Math: Think programmers, developers, and analysts. (Fun fact: They are only 3% of US workers, but drive 37% of all Claude conversations. This can probably partially explain the boom in AI coding co-pilots. Developers use Ai, love it, and are smart enough to build better ones,  even if it means automating themselves out of a job one day! 🤖 - They can't resist it)\n2️⃣ Art & Media: Editors, writers, and designers \n3️⃣ Education + Sciences: teachers, tutors, scientists, historians etc. \n\nFor roles with a high percentage of US workers but low AI engagement on Claude, some are simply offline (like transportation). But others—think sales, healthcare, general management—could be ripe for some innovative AI disruption!",

      "🔥 I agree with Bessemer Venture Partners that the Future of B2B AI is Vertical - here is why \n\n1️⃣ Faster Path to Value\nNarrowing down beats going broad. Just look at Synthesia—they started as a LLM for digital avatars but then focused on enterprise L&D to gain traction. Once they nailed that, they expanded into marketing, product demos, and more.\n\nI've seen this pattern over & over again in Ai startups. Instead of marketing a broad technology to solve problems for everyone, startups that focus on a narrow vertical & use case can demonstrate functional & economic value much faster. \n\n2️⃣ Unique Insights & Data are Your Moat\nTech alone isn’t enough. The best AI startups leverage proprietary data and vertical insights to build a moat.\n\nExample? OWKIN in healthcare—they use federated learning to train models on sensitive medical data across hospitals without centralizing it. \n\nIf you’re just using off-the-shelf LLMs with no unique data/insights, expect firece competitions from 100+ other startups. \n\n3️⃣ Avoid the Head-on Battle with Incumbents\nHorizontal SaaS giants are already embedding AI—Slack, Notion, HubSpot, you name it. Competing head-on is a grind.\n\nLook at AI code editors like Cursor and Codium—they’re outperforming GitHub Copilot now, but long-term? GitHub still owns the DevOps workflow, giving them time to catch up. \n\nMeanwhile, Cognition (Devin) isn’t just adding AI to coding—it’s reimagining the workflow entirely, and maybe that's how disruptors can take on the platforms? \n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all strategy, but vertical AI startups win by solving high-value, domain-specific problems better than anyone else. The best ones don’t just add AI—they rethink workflows from the ground up that were impossible pre-LLM.",

      'On Friday, I hosted a dinner with a group of CROs and GTM executives from fast-growing B2B startups. These are people who’ve scaled teams into the hundreds\n\nPeople drove for hours to be there\n\nWhat started as polite networking turned into one of the most honest conversations I’ve ever had about what it really takes to scale\n\nHere are the takeaways that hit the hardest\n\n1. Partnerships\n\nEveryone agreed that partnerships are hit-or-miss.\nROI is inconsistent. Timelines are unpredictable.\n\nBut when you find the right partner and go deep with full integration?\nIt becomes your most valuable growth channel.\n\nThe key? Staying in the game long after others give up.\n\n2. The Hidden Cost of Hiring the Wrong Exec\n\n- Tactical gaps. \n- Board referrals gone wrong. \n- Cultural breakdowns.\n\nOne company had fired 5x more people than they currently employ, because they refuse to compromise on culture fit\n\nAs one CRO put it: "Fire fast or watch your culture die slow."\n\nAnother exec shared this hiring litmus test:\n“If I called them at 2AM on a Sunday with an urgent issue, would they pick up, or wait for Monday?”\n\nExtreme? Maybe.\nEffective at finding people who truly want it? Absolutely.\n\nMy biggest takeaway was that:\n\n- GTM candidates are pros at selling themselves.\n- They’ll tell you exactly what you want to hear.\n\nThe only way to cut through the pitch?\nTry carrying out anonymous reference checks\n\nShout out to everyone who came through\n\nMarcus Mares, Mugais Jahangir, Patrick Lee, Maria Novikova, Danny Khukalenko, Olivier Thibault, Bobby Green, Saif Iqbal, Ajax W.',

      '8 founders. $1B+ in revenue and funding. One breakfast table.\n\nYesterday, I hosted a private breakfast with some of the most impressive founders in tech, quietly building 8- and 9-figure companies while staying heads-down and mission-focused.\n\nIn the room we had:\n– The founder of Ipsy ($250M+ revenue, 1000+ employees)\n– CEO from HelloFresh (pet food division)\n– Founders of Boast AI, Tri Carter, and more…\n\nCollectively, these founders have built or raised over $1B+.\n\nAnd yet, you’d never guess it from how grounded the room felt.\n\nIt was part of Toronto Tech Week, a week packed with big panels, big names, and even bigger energy.\n\nBut honestly? This tiny breakfast might’ve been the most powerful part of the week.\n\nHere’s what stood out from our conversation:\n\n1. Trust is the new sales funnel.\n2. Fundraising ≠ Business Building.\n3. LinkedIn content has become essential for B2B sales\n4. Small, closed-door conversations \u003E Big panels with investors\n\nWhat hit me most?\n\nThere’s been a total mindset shift in the last few years.\n\n2022: “Why would I, as a CEO, waste time posting content?”\n2024: "I\'m a CEO, how do I build trust with my audience at scale?"\n\nEvery founder is now thinking about content strategy. \n\nPersonal brand isn’t fluff anymore, it’s a core part of your go-to-market.\n\nWant to join our next private roundtable?\n\nComment below with the number that best describes you:\n\n1. Seed & Series A Stage Founders ($3M+ raised/revenue)\n2. Series A–D Stage Founders ($20M+ raised/revenue)\n3. 7 & 8 Figure Agency Owners ($5M+ revenue)\n4. GTM Execs (CEOs, CROs, CMOs, VPs of Sales/Marketing)\n5. VCs (GPs & Partners)\n\nShout out to Laurent Guillemain, Justin Herlick, Levi Goertz, John Than, Carlos Coelho, MBA, Andy Keith, Marcelo Camberos for attending.',

      "Just wrapped up a private dinner with 5 top go-to-market executives at companies with a combined $500B+ in annual revenue, and we had a brutally honest conversation about what's broken in startup communities:\n\nMost have become way too transactional.\n\nEvent hosts are selling tickets, pushing massive sponsorship slots, promoting their coaching programs at every turn.\n\nIt's obvious they're commercializing relationships instead of building genuine community.\n\nThe problem with this approach:\n\n- Attendees keep their guard up the entire time\n- Real insights get buried under sales pitches\n- People network to GET something, not GIVE something\n- Short-term monetization kills long-term trust\n\nWhich is why we flipped the script:\n\nWe cover dinner. No pitches allowed. No hidden agendas.\n\nJust genuine executives sharing real strategies, real challenges, real wins.\n\nThe result?\nThese leaders opened up about things they'd never share at a \"networking event\":\n\n- When to actually hire your first RevOps person (hint: earlier than you think)\n- Why most GTM strategies fail in execution\n- The side businesses and passion projects they're all building\n- Unfiltered takes on the state of tech and business policies\n\nHere's what I've learned about community building:\n\nYou can't be thinking short-term when it comes to relationships.\n\nYes, I'm a business person. I care about ROI.\n\nBut when you approach community with an abundance mindset. Give first, add value, play the long game, that's when magic happens.\n\nYou never know who will be the next Mark Zuckerberg or Satya Nadella at your table.\n\nMore intimate dinners coming soon\n\nWant to join our next private roundtable?\n\nComment below with the number that best describes you:\n\n1.

Most of them are lies.\n\nOctober 2023: I started posting consistently with 5K followers.\n\nAt first, engagement was through the roof.\nFriends were hyping every post.\nI thought I cracked the code.\n\nThen reality hit. The algorithm pulled the rug.\n\n→ Engagement dropped 75%.\n→ 100-like posts dropped to 20.\n→ It felt like I was posting into the void.\n\nBut I kept posting. Every. Single. Day.\n\nDecember came, finally, a breakthrough.\nOne post popped. Then another.\nI climbed to 7K followers.\n\nI thought I was back.\n\nThen the holidays came. I got busy with the startup.\n\nTook a \"quick\" two-week break from posting.\n\nCame back in January… and boom:\nEngagement tanked again - down 3X.\nI had to rebuild from scratch. Again.\n\nAnd here’s the part that’ll surprise you:\n\nI’ve been creating viral content for 10+ years.\nMillions of followers across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok.\n\nBut LinkedIn took me six months to figure out.\n\nThere are no shortcuts. There's no hack. There's no \"one weird trick.\"\n\nIt's just showing up when you don't want to. Posting when your engagement sucks. Experimenting when nothing's working.",

      "I've published 120 posts in the last 180 days that have garnered 4.1M impressions and 31k engagements. During this time, I've gone from 3K to 22K followers. More importantly, I've booked 800+ meetings, closed deals and raised funds for Virio.\n\nWhy every CEO (or even every business professional) doesn't do this, is beyond me.\n\nSo, in an attempt to encourage you to get started (or do more), here's how I approach LinkedIn differently that makes it easy for me (and may make it easier for you.)\n\n1. I treat content like product development, not marketing\n\nMost people post randomly and hope something sticks. I run calculated experiments with different content pillars and formats, analyze the data, then double down on what works.\n\nJust like finding product-market fit, I was searching for content-market fit - that sweet spot where my content consistently resonates with my target ICP and drives real pipeline. It took months of testing, but once I found it, everything exploded.\n\n2. I focus on top-of-funnel before throwing money at ads\n\nWhile everyone else is burning cash on LinkedIn ads without knowing what works, I perfected my organic content first. You can't scale what you haven't proven organically. I've figured out exactly what messaging and content formats convert my audience, then I have a blueprint worth investing paid dollars behind.\n\n3. I stayed consistent\n\nLinkedIn will give you an initial boost when you start posting, then completely crush your engagement to test if you're serious. My engagement dropped 75% after the first few weeks. I almost quit. But I kept posting every single day through months of what felt like screaming into the void. The breakthrough only came because I survived the algorithm's games and didn't give up when things got hard.\n\nIf more people treated LinkedIn like a place to learn, test, and connect, instead of a stage to sell, we’d all benefit.\n\nIt’s about being consistent, curious, and customer-focused.\n\nThis approach doesn’t require a team or a big budget.\n\nJust a willingness to show up.",

      "Yesterday I spoke with a CMO at a 9-figure company who asked: “How do we turn LinkedIn into a scalable marketing channel?” Here’s the play:\n\n1. The CEO = The Vision Setter\n\nThey’re not there to chase leads\nTheir job is to shape the bigger story:\n\n→ Where the industry is going\n→ What the company stands for\n→ What big bets and product launches are coming next\n\nThe CEO’s role is to set the narrative and get the market talking.\n\n2. The Executives = The Conversion Engines\n\nEach executive owns a specific audience segment\nAnd speaks directly to their pain points:\n\n→ VP of Sales targeting manufacturing shares real-world case studies on boosting factory efficiency\n→ VP of Product shares real user feedback and how it makes their product the best in market\n→ Head of Sales targeting financial services, shares market insights on the state of the financial services market\n\nSame company\nDifferent voices\n\nLaser-focused messages that actually convert.\n\nThe result?\nTotal market domination.\n\nWhen your ideal buyer opens LinkedIn, they see:\n\n- CEO driving the big picture\n- VPs speaking to their specific pain\n- Case studies, playbooks, and POVs across the board\n\nYou become unavoidable.\n\nMost companies have 5–10 execs doing nothing on LinkedIn.\n\nThat’s like owning Ferraris but walking to work.\n\nIf you want to unlock millions in pipeline by activating your executive team, let’s talk.\n\nDrop a comment and I’ll show you the blueprint.",

      "STOP being overly thankful in your networking and marketing.\n\nIt’s making you look junior.\n\nI keep seeing DMs and posts like:\n\n“Thank you so much for the opportunity to connect! I’m incredibly grateful and truly honored to be in touch with you.”\n\nOr:\n\n“We’re just so thankful for all the support. We really appreciate everyone who checked out our launch!”\n\nHere’s the issue:\n\nWhen you lead with gratitude, you shrink your authority.\n\nYou’re not a fan. You’re a peer.\n\nTry this instead:\n\n→ Shift from thanks to value\nTry this: “Your post on X was insightful, here’s a quick POV you might appreciate.”\nNot “thanks for connecting”\n\n→ Drop the emotional language\nTry this: “Here’s what we’re building and why it matters.”\nNo more “excited,” “grateful,” “honored.”\n\n→ Position yourself as an equal\nYou don’t need to earn a seat at the table\nShow up with insight. \nOpen a door with relevance.\n\n→ Set a tone of forward motion\nTry this: “This post sparked a few ideas; let’s set up 15mins next week.”\nNot: “Would love to maybe connect sometime if you’re open to it…“\n\nGratitude has its place.\n\nBut if every message reads like a thank-you note, you’re playing from behind.\n\nSeriously, appreciate you reading this 😄",

      "How I'd fill pipeline from scratch if I was the CMO of a $100M ARR business.\n\n(Send this to your CEO)\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1. Start creating CONSISTENT CONTENT:\n\nWith your entire executive team\n\nBuyers don't buy from brands these days.\n\nThey buy from PEOPLE they trust.\n\nAnd to trust someone,\n\n↳ You need to see their face\n↳ Hear their voice\n↳ Understand their thinking\n\n2. Produce VIDEO content aggressively\n\nText content is great for top-of-funnel\n\nBut video builds trust for middle and bottom funnel.\n\n↳ Have your go-to-market execs visualize your solution\n↳ Have them show up on camera and humanize the solution.\n\n3. Only THEN start running ads\n\nThis is the correct order.\n\nSo many CMOs get this backward.\n\n↳ Don’t spend a dime until you’ve hit content-market fit organically.\n↳ Once you know which content resonates with your ICP\n↳ Then throw fuel on the fire with paid distribution.\n\n4. Host intimate executive dinners\n\nForget fancy booths at trade shows. Instead,\n\n↳ Gather 10-12 people from your ICP\n↳ Host exclusive, intimate dinners.\n\nThese small gatherings create more pipeline than any trade show booth ever will.\n\n5. Meet prospects in person\n\nContent builds the best top-of-funnel at scale\n\nBut B2B enterprise sales still requires face time.\n\n↳ When prospects have already consumed your content online,\n↳ They'll be warmed up and ready to close in person.\n\nThat's it.\n\nFive channels. Five investments. One scalable pipeline.\n\nWhat would you add or change to this plan? Comment below.",

Here are 6 ways to do it:\n\n\nCONTEXT \n\nLast week, our Strategic RevOps cheat sheet went viral.\n\nSo we recorded an entire podcast episode to go deeper.\n\n(Just search for 'RevOps Lab' in your podcast app)\n\n\n👉 Here are 6 ways to become more strategic:\n\n𝟭. 𝗔𝗻𝗻𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: 𝗢𝘄𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗧𝗠 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻\n\nCreate the bottom-up GTM plan.\nMap it against top-down FP&A.\nHighlight the gaps.\n\nThis gives you exposure to every exec, every trade-off, and every strategic bet.\n\n\n𝟮. 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻\n\nBreak the annual plan into quarters.\n\nSet up operating cadences.\n\nHold teams accountable by aligning forecasts with actuals.\n\nWeekly, monthly, quarterly.\n\nDon't just report numbers.

𝗚𝗧𝗠 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆: 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗹𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗶𝗴 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘀\n\nWhere should we invest? \n\nWhich geo, segment, ICP, or product?\n\nThese decisions involve trade-offs, risk, and high stakes.\n\nRevOps has the data and perspective to shape these conversations.\n\n\n𝟰. 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗟𝗶𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁\n\nPast $10M+ ARR, expansion \u003E acquisition.\n\nFocus on improving onboarding, adoption, expansion, and retention.\n\nScaling revenue lives in the post-sale motion.\n\n\n𝟱.

      "In 2025, the best RevOps teams use AI notetakers. Here's what 99% of them still get WRONG (+ how to fix it):\n\n\nCONTEXT\n\nFull transparency.\n\nI run Weflow (a Gong alternative at 50% the price).\n\nOur team has seen 1,000+ AI notetaker setups.\n\nFrom SMBs to Enterprise.\n\nAnd there's ONE thing that almost all do wrong.\n\n(Which destroys their Salesforce data quality):\n\nThey use separate tools for their AI notetaker (or Conversation Intelligence) and Activity Capture.\n\nThe problem:\n\nBoth create an event record in Salesforce.\n\nThe consequences:\n\n • Duplicate events\n • Messy activity reporting\n • Low trust in data\n • More RevOps admin\n\nInstead, unify both tools to capture:\n\n- emails\n- meetings\n- recordings\n- transcripts\n- attachments\n- AI summaries\n- AI field updates\n...\n\n(Side note: 200+ B2B revenue teams now happily do this with Weflow).\n\n\n👉 Check for these 5 MUST-HAVE capabilities:\n\n𝟭. 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹, 𝗻𝗼 𝗱𝘂𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀\n\nIf a meeting is recorded:\n\n- transcripts\n- AI summaries\n- and the calendar event\n\nshould be combined into ONE Salesforce event.\n\nMake sure to have central access permission to all calendars.\n\nThis prevents data gaps and the need for end-user installs.\n\n\n𝟮. 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼-𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀 & 𝗺𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀\n\nThere are many details to capturing 99.9% of activities reliably.\n\nExamples:\n\n • Are activities permanently stored?\n • Are meetings captured if not recorded?\n • Are incoming & outgoing emails captured?\n • Are there manual controls in Outlook/Google?\n • Are activities auto-mapped to the right record?\n • Can you set up multiple configurations (AE, CSMs)?\n\n\n𝟯. 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲\n\nReps never manually create contacts from calendar events (or email threads).\n\nSo automate it.\n\nDetails that matter:\n\n • Domain exclusions (@gmail.com, @yahoo.com)\n • Email name exclusions (invoice@, billing@)\n • Only create contacts for existing accounts\n • End user controls in Outlook/Google\n\n\n𝟰. 𝗔𝗜 𝗺𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀\n\nYour notetaker's meeting summaries should be stored in the event object.\n\nDetails that matter:\n\n• Can you create custom AI summary templates?\n• Can you combine multiple prompts/templates?\n• Can you assign templates to user profiles?\n\n\n𝟱. 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼-𝗽𝗼𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗖𝗥𝗠 𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱𝘀\n\nDo you use your notetakers to populate Salesforce fields with AI?\n\nThe best teams do.\n\n↳ Improves CRM data hygiene.\n↳ Drives productivity gains\n↳ Reps love it!\n\nHere are details that matter:\n\n• Which objects can be updated (Opps, Accounts...)\n• Supported field types (Amount, Picklists...)\n• Can admins map fields to AI prompts\n• Can you build a prompt library\n• Can admins adjust AI prompts\n• Are custom objects supported\n\nAnything I missed? Let me know. 👇 \n\n\n____\n𝗣𝗦: 𝗪𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘂𝗽? \n\nGet our FREE AC & CI Cheat Sheet:\n\n1. Like + comment \"AC+CI\"\n2. Add me on LI (so I can share it)",

      "Every RevOps person I know tells me the same thing: reps won't update Salesforce. Here are 5 things you can do about it with AI:\n\nFor context:\n\nScaling Weflow we've analyzed deal hygiene across 600+ Salesforce instances.\n\nIt's always the same story:\n • No contact roles\n • Missing next steps\n • Email and meetings not synced\n • Poor stage entry/exit criteria compliance\n • Incomplete MEDDPICC fields (SPICED, etc.)\n • ...\n\nI believe RevOps is best equipped to solve it!\n\n\n𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝘆:\n\nWe treat poor deal hygiene as a \"behavior problem\".\n\nAll reps have the ability to update Salesforce. \n\nBut still, they don't do it. They hate it. \n\nThey feel they get nothing back.\n\nWe spend months reminding & training them. \n\nYet, nothing fundamentally changes.\n\nIt's frustrating!\n\nI believe \"updating Salesforce\" is a tech problem.\n\nAnd we in RevOps can solve it the best.\n\nRule-based systems helped a bit.\n\nBut AI unlocks capabilities unmatched before.\n\n\n𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝟱 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀:\n\n(Weflow does all of this, by the way)\n\n\n𝟭. 𝗔𝗜 𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀\n\nConnect any Salesforce field across any object to AI prompts to auto-populate those fields from your meeting transcripts or emails.\n\nReps get an email after the meeting to review, adjust, and update those fields.\n\nIt's fast, it's easy.\n\n(Weflow does that, by the way)\n\n\n𝟮. 𝗔𝗜 𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀\n\nAI notetakers write summaries into the description field in the event object in Salesforce.\n\nImportant: Your notetaker should not create a duplicate event in addition to your activity capture solution. \n\nPro tip: Consolidate Conversation Intelligence and Activity Capture to resolve this issue.\n\n\n𝟯. 𝗔𝗜 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 & 𝗺𝗮𝗽𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀\n\nAI recognizes \"new contacts\" in email threads and calendar events, and automatically adds them to Salesforce.\n\nHint: Use a solution that offers manual controls in Outlook / Gmail for a hybrid approach.\n\n\n𝟰. 𝗔𝗜 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀\n\nAI analyzes your activity, conversation, and CRM data to automatically provide deal summaries and suggest field updates.\n\n\n𝟱. 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲\n\nAuto-capture and map emails & meetings from Google/Outlook to Salesforce. \n\nHint: Use a tool that provides manual controls in Gmail/ Outlook for higher mapping accuracy.\n\n\n\nPS: I created 3 FREE cheat sheets to help you get better Salesforce data:\n\n1 - AI Notetaker for Salesforce:\nhttps://lnkd.in/e4HznvpK\n\n2 - Salesforce Activity Capture\nhttps://lnkd.in/eBvYpR_8\n\n3 - Salesforce Data Hygiene:\nhttps://lnkd.in/eu3-a76r",

      "In 2025, there's no excuse for poor Salesforce deal hygiene. Here are 6 things the best RevOps teams do to get it right:\n\nFor context:\n • I scaled Fyber from 0-76M in ARR\n • I've been running GTM teams for 15 years\n • SFDC deal hygiene has ALWAYS been a struggle\n\nHere is the reality:\n 1. Reps hate CRM data entry\n 2. Managers hate reminding them\n 3. RevOps triages tools, processes & humans\n 4. Executives don't trust the metrics & forecast\n\nNobody wins!\n\nAnd the truth is:\n\nTechnology has become so good, there's no excuse anymore.\n\nHere are 6 ways to solve it:\n\n#𝟭 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼-𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗖𝗥𝗠 𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱𝘀 (𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗠𝗘𝗗𝗗𝗜𝗖, 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀)\n\nKey CRM fields are often empty or miss details.\n\nFix:\n 1. Record & transcribe calls\n 2. Map CRM fields to AI prompts\n 3. Populate text, multi-select, dropdown fields\n 4. Reps should only review, adjust, and confirm\n\nTools:\n • Weflow\n • Attention\n • Gong\n\n#𝟮 𝗠𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼-𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘁\n\nReps should focus on the conversation, not take notes.\n\nFix:\n 1. Record & transcribe the meeting\n 2. AI summarizes the conversation\n 3. AI updates the note (in ONE event object)\n\nTools: see above.\n\nPS: The best tools allow admins to create AI summary templates for different user profiles. \n\nExamples:\n- SPICED for AEs\n- Account health indicators for CS\n\n#𝟯 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼-𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀 & 𝗺𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀\n\nIt's table stakes.\n\nYet, many teams don't do it (reliably).\n\nFix:\n 1. Install an activity capture app\n 2. Configure your setup & enroll users centrally\n 3. Automatically capture emails & meetings\n 4. Provide manual controls in Outlook/Google\n\nTools:\n • Weflow\n • Revenue Grid\n • Cirrus Insights\n\n#𝟰 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲\n\nMulti-threading is more important than ever - but reps hardly ever add contacts to Salesforce.\n\nEspecially those contacts that are added to email threads or customer meetings later on.\n\nThis means: \n- No visibility into the buying committee\n- Wrong multi-threading metrics\n\nFix:\nIdeally, your activity capture solution covers this (see above).\n\n#𝟱 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝘆/𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗮 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄\n\nDocumenting entry/exit criteria is \"easy\".\n\nHaving reps adopt them is hard.\n\nFix\n 1. Define stage entry/exit criteria\n 2. Document & train the team - again & again\n 3. Use auto-field updates to populate relevant fields\n 4. Implement page layouts & paths for compliance\n\nTools:\n • CRM (SFDC, Hubspot,...)\n • AI notetaker with AI field updates (see above)\n\n#𝟲 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗵𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 & 𝗱𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 \n\nIt's table stakes, but crucial. \n\nFix:\n 1. Run dedupe jobs monthly \n 2. Use multiple unique identifiers\n 3. Automate the enrichment process\n 4. Review key fields (email, phone, domain)\n\nTools: \n • Clay\n • Apollo\n • ZoomInfo\n\nWhich tools am I missing? 👇",

      "We teamed up with a VP, RevOps at a $46M ARR company to help solve 6 challenges on forecasting. Here is what we did: \n\nFor context some metrics on last quarter: \n\nPipeline coverage in week 4 was 2.8x.\n\nCoverage dropped to 1.4x in week 8 (- $7.4M).\n\nThey ended the quarter at 82%.\n\n𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝟲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 (+ 𝗳𝗶𝘅𝗲𝘀):\n\n𝟭. 𝗗𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗵𝘆𝗴𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗽𝗼𝗼𝗿\n- Activity data was missing\n- 62% if MEDDICC fields were empty\n- Next steps fields were mostly empty\n\nAll this required manual data entry that reps tried to avoid as it slowed them down.\n\nFix:\n↳ Automated activity capture (Weflow Activity Capture)\n↳ Automated field updates (Weflow Conversation Intelligence)\n\nPS: Comment „Salesforce Data Capture“ to get our free cheat sheet on the topic.\n\n𝟮. 𝗗𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘀 𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗽𝘂𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗿\n\nBetween week 4 to 8, 23% of deals were pushed to the next quarter. The problem was that manager didn't know which deals were pushed.\n\nFix:\n↳ Added „push count“ to pipeline views\n↳ Added \"pushed deals\" column to roll-up views\n\n𝟯. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘀 𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 \n\nAfter week 6+, 16% of deals were not advancing. \n\nWhy?\n\nAfter automating activity capture, we saw that:\n↳ prospects didn’t reply to emails\n↳ many deals had no next meeting scheduled\n\nFix:\n↳ Added warnings for stalling deals\n↳ Surfaced emails & meetings in pipeline views\n↳ Introduced reassignment rule for stalling deals\n\n𝟰. 𝗗𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝘀 𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲\n\nManagers used deal reviews to find out if deals are healthy without a framework nor visibility.\n\nWhy?\n\nVisibility into deal health was poor due to:\n↳ missing deal hygiene\n↳ missing MEDDIC framework\n↳ missing warnings, signals, and insights\n\nFix:\n↳ Used MEDDICC data to run deal reviews\n↳ Trained managers on effective deal reviews\n↳ Created views that showcase the right warnings, signals and fields to identify risks easier.\n\n𝟱. 𝗕𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗺-𝘂𝗽 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗮𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆\n\nOnly Managers submitted forecast calls.\n\nWhy?\nManager forecasts were tracked in a spreadsheet which didn't scale to have reps submit as well.\n\nFix:\n↳ Asked rep to submit forecast calls\n↳ Introduced deal-by-deal bottom-up forecasting\n↳ Used Deal Intelligence for Manager adjustments\n\n𝟲. 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼𝗼 𝗳𝗲𝘄 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀\n\nTeam only replied on Manager and Weighted Forecast\n\nWhy?\n↳ Stage conversation rates were hard coded\n↳ Spreadsheet made rep forecast impossible\n\nFix:\n↳ Added Weflow’s AI forecasting prediction\n↳ Added dynamic weighted forecast\n↳ Added RevOps technical forecast\n\nWhat would you add? 👇\n\n-\nPS: Check out Weflow to automate Salesforce data capture and improve forecasting accuracy.\n\n🆓 Get our free Forecasting Cheat Sheet\n\n↳ Like + comment „forecast“ or „Weflow Revenue AI“\n↳ Add me on LinkedIn (so I can send it to you)",

      "I spoke to a RevOps Leader at a $42M ARR co who spent six figures on MEDDPICC...but reps weren't using it. Here's what we discussed (+ fixes):\n\nFirst, we analyzed why MEDDPICC adoption was low.\n\nHere is how RevOps explained it nicely:\n\n • Reps feel it's more work\n • Reps say it's not helping them close deals\n • Managers don't enforce it in 1-1s & deal reviews\n • CRO only looks at swing deals where data is good\n\n...and here are the hard numbers:\n\n • 67% of all MEDDPICC fields are empty\n • 28% of populated fields only had 15 words or less\n\n...and here is why they introduced MEDDPICC:\n\n • Win rates were too low\n • Deals often stall in stage\n • Pipeline coverage drops mid-quarter\n • Deal reviews were missing a framework\n • Quota attainment spread widely across the team\n • YoY Growth rates dropped to single digits\n\nNot a good place to be in as a hyper-growth company.\n\nAs you know, there isn't an \"easy\" fix as it's a:\n\n • Change management problem\n • Enablement problem\n • Process problem\n • Tool problem\n\n𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝟲 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀 𝘄𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗠𝗘𝗗𝗗𝗣𝗜𝗖𝗖 𝗮𝗱𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:\n\n𝟭 - 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝘀\n\nGoals: \n • Free reps from MEDDPICC data entry\n • Improve MEDDPICC data quality\n\nHow?\nReps adopted Weflow's AI Notetaker to auto-update Salesforce fields. After a meeting, reps get an email to update fields, review populated fields, edit if necessary, and click update!\n\nResults:\n • 1 min instead of 10 min manual data entry.\n • 82% of MEDDPICC fields populated.\n\n𝟮 - 𝗠𝗘𝗗𝗗𝗣𝗜𝗖𝗖-𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝘀\n\nGoal: Ensure MEDDPICC is used in deal reviews\n\nHow?\nWe created a deal review pipeline view displaying all MEDDPICC fields to ensure reps and managers look at it again and again.\n\nPlus, Enablement trained managers on MEDDPICC-first deal reviews\n\n𝟯 - 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗠𝗘𝗗𝗗𝗣𝗜𝗖𝗖 𝘀𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀\n\nGoal: Display how MEDDPICC helps to win deals\n\nHow?\n • Analyze win rate of closed-won deals\n • Display difference to non-compliant deals\n • Communicate, communicate, communicate\n\nResult: Reps finally understand why it matters.\n\n𝟰 - 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗴𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁 𝗠𝗘𝗗𝗗𝗣𝗜𝗖𝗖\n\nGoal: Level up rep performance\n\nHow?\nWeflow's AI Coaching gives feedback and scores every meeting against MEDDPICC. \n\nPlus, Enablement scheduled group sessions to share learnings on MEDDPICC.\n\nResult:\nTo early to tell tbh.\n\n𝟱 - 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀\nGoal: Improve MEDDPICC adoption through training\n\nHow?\nIn addition to the group session above, we created a MEDDPICC certificate, which was a mixture of self-coaching, call reviews, and practical training sessions.\n\n𝟲 - 𝗢𝗻𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀\nGoal: Incorporate MEDDPICC into onboarding to reduce ramp time\n\nHow?\n • MEDDPICC handbook\n • Multiple training sessions\n • Library clips to share best practice usage\n\nWant to try Weflow for free?

      "Spoke to a VP, RevOps of a $32M ARR company about Salesforce hygiene. Here are the 3 problems she faced (+ how to fix them):\n\nFirst, we audited the Opportunity data in Salesforce.\n\nHere is what we found:\n • 72% had ALL MEDDIC fields empty\n • 63% had inaccurate activities\n • 23% had overdue close dates\n • 46% had no next steps\n\nHere is how the VP described the ripple effects in the organization:\n\n1. Inspecting Opportunity health was impossible\n2. Deal reviews have become interrogations\n3. Managers cannot forecast their territories\n4. Preparing forecasting meetings takes ages\n5. Pipeline coverage evaporates mid-quarter\n6. The CRO is deeply annoyed (rightly so)\n7. Board pressure is rising.\n\nHere are 3 root causes we identified (+ fixes):\n\n1. Siloed transcript data\n\nUsing a 1st gen AI notetaker caused problems:\n • AI summaries not synced to Salesforce\n • Meetings created duplicate events in SFDC\n • No capability to auto-update fields in SFDC\n\nThe fix:\nPiloting Weflow Conversation Intelligence\n\n2. Ineffective activity capture\nActivities were missing and not mapping accurately to Opportunities. \n\nHere is the setup (and the problem):\n • AEs used a Gmail extension to log emails\n • The Gmail extension only logged outgoing emails\n • Low adoption as anual and time-consuming (3-4 clicks/ email)\n • AE constantly needed to re-authentificate\n • So, many didn't bother to log emails anymore\n\nPS: They tried Einstein Activity Capture but stopped using it because of reporting, mapping, and data persistence reasons.\n\nThe fix\n1 - Automating activities capture\n2 - Manual controls in Gmail\n3 - Visibility in deal reviews\n\nCombining automated activity capture with manual controls in Gmail & Google Calendar allowed them to accurately map to Opportunities using Weflow's Activity Capture product.\n\n3. Missing process compliance\n\nThe team was overwhelmed with the Salesforce instance. \n\nThe problems:\n • Unclear what to do in which stage\n • Too many fields\n • No training\n\nThe fix\n1 - Simplify required fields\n\nKeep it to 5-7 must-have fields. Remove nice-to-have fields. Focus on deal-critical information\n\n2 - Entry/ exit criteria\n\nDefine Setup views to enable your middle management to discuss \"non-compliant\" opportunities\n\n3 - Training\nIntroduced regular trainings and improved onboarding process to ensure process compliance.\n\nWhat would you add?",
